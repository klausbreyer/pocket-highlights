# Pocket-Highlights

I started this open source project to extracts my Highlights from [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com) and optimize the format for easy copy & paste into [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com).

While doing so, my personal extracted highlights are also publicly available: https://pocket.v01.io

## Documentation 
* The core is based on this Python Package: https://github.com/karlicoss/pockexport
* But it is extented by my individual convert Script in Node to create html.
* The whole thing is then published daily init to a github page.

## Setup
* Fork this repository. 

## Development
* for dev: Makefile
* for prod: github action
