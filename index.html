<title>Pocket Highlights</title><h1>Systems design explains the world: volume 1, 2020</h1><aside>2020-12-29 01:18:41: "Systems design" is a branch of study that tries to find universal architectural patterns that are valid across disciplines. You might think that's not a possibility. Back in university, students used to tease the Systems Design Engineers, calling it "boxes and arrows" engineering. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227" target="_blank">https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227</a></li><li>With systems design, the key insight might be a one-sentence explanation given at the right time to the right person, that affects the next 5 years of work, or is the difference between hypergrowth and steady growth.,<li>Our team felt flat and egalitarian. But you can't ever forget that it was only that way because you forced it to be that way.",<li>A "disruptive" innovation was meant to refer to specifically the kind you see in that plot up above: the kind where an entirely new thing sucks for a very long time, and then suddenly and instantly blows you away. This is the kind that creates the dilemma.,<li>if you were a Novice going for Junior, you had to prove you could fix bugs without too much supervision; going for Senior, you had to prove you could implement a whole design without too much supervision; going for Staff, you had to show you could produce designs based on business problems with basically no management; going for Senior Staff, you had to solve bigger and bigger business problems; and so on.</ul><hr />
<h1>Validation is a mirage, Jason Fried, 2020</h1><aside>2020-12-27 03:10:09: Spend enough time talking with entrepreneurs, product people, designers, and anyone charged with proving something, and you’ll bump into questions about validation. You can’t. You can’t. You can’t. You can’t. You can’t. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/validation-is-a-mirage/" target="_blank">https://m.signalvnoise.com/validation-is-a-mirage/</a></li><li>If you want to see if something works, make it. The whole thing. The simplest version of the whole thing – that’s what version 1.0 is supposed to be. But make that, put it out there, and learn. If you want answers, you have to ask the question, and the question is: Market, what do you think of this completed version 1.0 of our product?
,<li>When I hear MVP, I don’t think Minimum Viable Product. I think Minimum Viable Pie. The food kind.
A slice of pie is all you need to evaluate the whole pie. It’s homogenous. But that’s not how products work. Products are a collection of interwoven parts, one dependent on another, one leading to another, one integrating with another. You can’t take a slice a product, ask people how they like it, and deduce they’ll like the rest of the product once you’ve completed it. All you learn is that they like or don’t like the slice you gave them.,<li>Truth is, you don’t know, you won’t know, you’ll never know until you know and reflect back on something real. And the best way to find out, is to believe in it, make it, and put it out there. You do your best, you promote it the best you can, you prepare yourself the best way you know how. And then you literally cross your fingers. I’m not kidding.
You can’t validate something that doesn’t exist. You can’t validate an idea. You can’t validate someone’s guess. You can’t validate an abstraction. You can’t validate a sketch, or a wireframe, or an MVP that isn’t the actual product.</ul><hr />

<h1>What comes after smartphones?, Benedict Evans, 2020</h1><aside>2020-12-17 10:35:49: For as long as most people can remember, the tech industry has had a new centre roughly every fifteen years. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/12/13/what-comes-after-smartphones" target="_blank">https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/12/13/what-comes-after-smartphones</a></li><li>There’s an old saying that the first fifty years of the car industry were about creating car companies and working out what cars should look like, and the second fifty years were about what happened once everyone had a car - they were about McDonalds and Walmart, suburbs and the remaking of the world around the car, for good and of course bad. The innovation in cars became everything around the car. </ul><hr />
<h1>How to Think for Yourself, 2020</h1><aside>2020-12-13 23:43:36: There are some kinds of work that you can't do well without thinking differently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for example, it's not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be both correct and novel. You can't publish papers saying things other people already know. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/think.html" target="_blank">http://paulgraham.com/think.html</a></li><li>The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert: fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to fill it.
Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one another in much the same way muscles can. If you're sufficiently fastidious about truth, you don't need to be as resistant to being told what to think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps in your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity, because if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiosity can compensate for them: if you're sufficiently curious, you don't need to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discover will push out the conventional ones you acquired by default.,<li>One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs are. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and make more effort to find out.,<li>You don't want to start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea, or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but that you know isn't like writing software for a tiny computer used by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people rent airbeds on strangers' floors.
Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already knew would be boring. You have to tell them something new.</ul><hr />
<h1>Container orchestration tools explained, 2020</h1><aside>2020-12-13 07:35:38: The way we write, ship, and maintain software today has evolved drastically in the last few years. How we consume underlying infrastructure to run our software has matured significantly, in that we have seen a transition from bare metal to virtual machines to containers to micro-VMs. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://dev.to/sarmadsaleem/container-orchestration-tools-explained-1c4i" target="_blank">https://dev.to/sarmadsaleem/container-orchestration-tools-explained-1c4i</a></li><li>An important distinction between virtual machines and containers is that VM virtualizes underlying hardware whereas the container virtualizes the underlying operating system.

<h1>Early Work, 2020</h1><aside>2020-10-25 11:07:55: One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on where they don't seem very impressive, even to their creators. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/early.html" target="_blank">http://paulgraham.com/early.html</a></li><li>The right way to deal with new ideas is to treat them as a challenge to your imagination not just to have lower standards, but to switch polarity entirely, from listing the reasons an idea won't work to trying to think of ways it could.,<li>Making new things is itself a new thing for us as a species. It has always happened, but till the last few centuries it happened so slowly as to be invisible to individual humans. And since we didn't need customs for dealing with new ideas, we didn't develop any.
We just don't have enough experience with early versions of ambitious projects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we would judge more finished work, or less ambitious projects. We don't realize they're a special case.</ul><hr />
<h1>Why Life Can’t Be Simpler, 2020</h1><aside>2020-12-10 23:36:31: We’d all like life to be simpler. But we also don’t want to sacrifice our options and capabilities. Tesler’s law of the conservation of complexity, a rule from design, explains why we can’t have both. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://fs.blog/2020/10/why-life-cant-be-simpler/" target="_blank">https://fs.blog/2020/10/why-life-cant-be-simpler/</a></li><li>As long as you pay your bills, the water supply to your house is probably fully automated. When you turn on a tap, you don’t need to have requested there to be water in the pipes first. The companies that manage the water supply handle the complexity.,<li>Complexity is like energy. It cannot be created or destroyed, only moved somewhere else. When a product or service becomes simpler for users, engineers and designers have to work harder. Norman writes, “With technology, simplifications at the level of usage invariably result in added complexity of the underlying mechanism. ” For example, the files and folders conceptual model for computer interfaces doesn’t change how files are stored, but by putting in extra work to translate the process into something recognizable, designers make navigating them easier for users.</ul><hr />
<h1>On Being Bipolar, Andrea Bennett, 2020</h1><aside>2020-10-05 09:48:43: Sometime in my mid-to-late twenties, less than a decade after I’d been diagnosed bipolar II, I participated in a study that sought to glean insights from “high-functioning” bipolar people—presumably to figure out why we were high functioning and if anything we had to share could help others </aside><ul><li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/on-being-bipolar/" target="_blank">https://thewalrus.ca/on-being-bipolar/</a></li><li>I don’t dream about not being bipolar, because I don’t know where my self ends and where the illness begins—and if there is even really a difference.

<h1>Marc Andreessen On Productivity, Scheduling, Reading Habits, Work, and More, Marc Andreessen,Sriram Krishnan, 2020</h1><aside>2020-09-21 12:18:07: This interview was recorded earlier this year and originally appeared on The Observer Effect; it has only been lightly edited for formatting here. Let’s get into it. Over a decade ago, you wrote a famous post called the ‘Pmarca guide to productivity‘. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/09/07/on-productivity-scheduling-reading-habits-marc-andreessen/" target="_blank">https://a16z.com/2020/09/07/on-productivity-scheduling-reading-habits-marc-andreessen/</a></li><li>It’s basically trying to try to fill in all the puzzle pieces for the big discrepancies.A great term is “sense-making”.

For any project, I’ve tried to identify the DRI. Who is the person responsible for delivering the project? If that’s me, then the project itself gets on my calendar.,<li>The firm is built to accomplish what I want to accomplish. And then my role here is to accomplish that within the context of the firm. And so the short answer is always the same — how do we optimize for the success of the firm? For the projects the firm is involved in, how do I optimize my contribution to that? So, you know, it’s been the same answer to the question every year for 11 years in a row and I don’t think it’ll change anytime soon. I think it’s more of trying to tune against a single goal as compared to trying to rethink the goals.</ul><hr />
<h1>How to be indistractable, Emma Warnock-Parkes, 2020</h1><aside>2020-12-22 08:30:05: Stop blaming technology – distraction starts within.

I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, I’d become the disciplined writer and focused father I’d always strived to be.
Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. ‘Hmmm,’ I said to myself, ‘I really should take a glance at this book’. I’d justify the distraction as necessary for ‘research’. And if it wasn’t reading, then I’d find something else – the laundry that needed to be folded right now, my desk that needed to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasn’t distracting me. I was distracting me.,<li>Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something,<li>I discovered that I was just as susceptible to being distracted by a news report or a dirty closet as I was by a glowing screen. Does that mean I cut out the news, or let my closets go? No. It meant having to figure out what I was avoiding (writing) and why I was avoiding it (all the writerly anxieties) and then dealing with those. It also meant building systems to manage my time, attention and internet use.</ul><hr />
<h1>Being OK With Not Being Extraordinary, 2020</h1><aside>2020-09-21 03:20:44: The internet always highlights the first place winners, the billionaires, the award-winning artists, the best-selling authors, the largest philanthropists, the extraordinary.

As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I’d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.
In the short term, this made me less efficient, because I’d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for long enough, I’d eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner’s API in a fit of rage. This resulted in me shipping my most important projects faster, hence getting faster compounding growth.</ul><hr />
<h1>Remote work is a platform, Jason Fried, 2020</h1><aside>2020-07-28 12:07:08: Back in the mid-90s, just as Netscape Navigator was giving us our first look at what the visual internet could be, web design came in two flavors.

<h1>Antifragility, 2020</h1><aside>2020-07-28 11:43:11: Upon request, I feel like I ought to explain some of these misunderstandings. I already wrote one a few months back on misunderstanding “skin in the game” (it’s not an incentive; it’s a filter). This week we’ll tackle another one: antifragility. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/03/12/antifragility/" target="_blank">https://alexdanco.com/2020/03/12/antifragility/</a></li><li>In a fragile system, that stressor creates uncertainty. You had a plan, and you were good to follow that plan so long as you stayed within a certain state. But now you’re thrown into a new state, so your plan no longer works. You’re in trouble. That’s fragility.
In a robust system, that stressor is information-neutral. You had a plan, and there’s enough buffer or slack in your system to absorb the stressor. Your state is resilient to the new challenge; the plan continues.
In an antifragile system, that stressor resolves uncertainty. You had no preexisting plan; the stressor tells you what to do. In an antifragile system, stressors are information. Without stressors, an antifragile system is rudderless. It doesn’t know how to grow or what to do. It actively suffers, until a challenge gives it direction.,<li>Accordingly, antifragile systems and organisms tend towards a common theme: bottoms-up decision-making, rather than top-down decision making. Antifragility requires real options, and real options are low-cost. Antifragility is only successful if you can actually detect, react, and grow in response to deviations from your present state in real time; the only way you can feasibly do this is for disorder detection and response to take place at a small enough resolution, and tight enough turnaround time. Top-down systems have a hard time with antifragility, because for them, all options are costly. ,<li>Antifragility is something you do, rather than something you have or something you are. Antifragility is an operating state of growing through continuous reaction. It’s like the opposite of predicting the future. You’re not making any forward-looking assumptions about anything, but you need disorder: you need a state change to have something to react to. Good antifragile systems react quickly and correctly, like the Hydra growing new heads when you cut one off. Without disorder, the Hydra doesn’t grow.

The east end of Toronto is home to a spectacular and unsanctioned, semi-secret network of mountain biking trails that line the river valley ravines. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://danco.substack.com/p/misunderstanding-skin-in-the-game" target="_blank">https://danco.substack.com/p/misunderstanding-skin-in-the-game</a></li><li>Upside incentive can matter a great deal, but it has almost nothing to do with skin in the game the way that Taleb uses the phrase. When Taleb talks about “Skin in the game”, he’s talking about survival. A small business owner does not have SitG because she’s incentivized to run her business well; she has SitG because if she doesn’t run her business well, then it doesn’t stick around. ,<li>just raise less money! It’ll force you to work harder, learner, and smarter, and it’ll force you to get things right faster, or run out of cash trying. But I’ll bet you that’s not what these people have in mind.,<li>The core, unifying theme across all of Taleb's writing - from his early work around randomness and The Black Swan through later works like Antifragility and Skin in the Game - is the logic of risk-taking. Taleb takes great offence at creating work, exercise, or any other kind of activity that’s designed to consciously offload risk from the participant; he’s particularly fond of complaining about elliptical machines at the gym, jogging, or really any kind of exercise that isn’t free weight deadlifting. But I have a distinct feeling that he would be willing to make an exception for trail running, which seems like it’d be a lot more in his ballpark.</ul><hr />
<h1>Systems thinking for startups, 2020</h1><aside>2020-10-05 09:57:29: Peter Senge has been called the most influential business strategists of the century and in my view Senge is the successor of Peter Drucker, the management visionary. Senge published a book in 1990 called The Fifth Discipline which I think every manager, founder and CEO should read. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.tomtunguz.com/learning-organizations/" target="_blank">https://www.tomtunguz.com/learning-organizations/</a></li><li>The systems viewpoint is generally oriented toward the long-term view. That’s why delays and feedback loops are so important. In the short term, you can often ignore them; they’re inconsequential. They only come back to haunt you in the long term.


				
				
				
				
			
		
		
		
	,<li>Thus, we may cut our advertising budgets, see the benefits in terms of cost savings, and in turn further trim spending in this area. In the short run there may be little impact on people’s demands for our goods and services, but longer term the decline in visibility may have severe penalties. An appreciation of systems will lead to recognition of the use of, and problems with, such reinforcing feedback, and also an understanding of the place of balancing (or stabilizing) feedback.
