    </p><h2>The Mindset That Kills Product Thinking, 2021</h2><aside>2021-08-06 20:52:14: My friend Marty Cagan released two articles, this one and this one, describing some of the challenges to product thinking. You should read them. He’s right. This article is about something more fundamental than that. It’s about the service provider anti-pattern baked into our processes. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.jpattonassociates.com/mindset-that-kills-product-thinking/" target="_blank">https://www.jpattonassociates.com/mindset-that-kills-product-thinking/</a></li><li>There’s one simple thing you and your team can do right now to start breaking the habit:  Reflect on the outcome of everything you release.  ,<li>Reread the agile manifesto and all those values and principles. Notice how they’re written from the service provider’s perspective. Notice how customer, user, and the business are used almost interchangeably. Look at values like: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation That’s exactly what I want when I hire a kitchen remodeler. But collaboration doesn’t make much sense when I choose a product to use. Look at principles like: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software This makes perfect sense if you’re building software for money,<li>Too much work, or extra unplanned work is a good thing for him. It’s called “demand” in product speak. If he has more demand than he can satisfy he can: Hire more people Raise prices to reduce demand Turn down work – which often makes him more desirable enhancing his brand,<li>I start lots of classes and talks by asking “what makes a product great?” Try this yourself right now. Think of a product you use routinely. Ask yourself why it’s great. Really. Pause and do that. I’ve done this long enough to know that a few things always come up. Things like: Easy to use Solves a problem Fun Delightful Saves me time ,<li>Service providers make money selling time and materials. The service they provide is the product.  Interestingly if your stakeholders love your work it likely doesn’t impact your business one way or another. And, I bet your company doesn’t make money selling your time and materials. And happy stakeholders giving you even more work isn’t helpful. It just buries you in more work. ,<li>After releasing a feature, use part of your team’s routine reflection or retrospective to discuss how long the whole feature actually took relative to what you’d planned. Discuss its quality. Those are the service provider outcomes and they do matter. But, remember, they’re table stakes. What matters more is the outcome. </ul><hr />
<h2>Almost-Billionaires, mikeBOS, 2021</h2><aside>2021-08-04 10:04:06: I was watching an episode of Jerry Seinfeld’s new project Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. It seems an alternative title could also be Almost-Billionaires In The Twilight of Their Careers. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://lackingambition.com/?p=1464" target="_blank">http://lackingambition.com/?p=1464</a></li><li>My own approach is to just keep the door open. I don’t have any big projects planned. Though I can see how building a business could be fun. Especially if you can do it without the stress of facing potential starvation and financial ruin if you don’t succeed.,<li>It seems there is something demotivating about financial independence. When you actually have the time, the money, the skills to do that great project you would have loved to had the resources to do when you were in college, suddenly it just doesn’t seem like such a great idea anymore</ul><hr />
<h2>We need to talk about testing, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-31 19:25:10: Or how programmers and testers can work together for a happy and fulfilling life. Why don’t we just automate all the testing? Is test coverage a useful metric? What does it mean to “shift testing left”? When and where should we be testing? How much is enough testing? </aside><ul><li><a href="https://dannorth.net/2021/07/26/we-need-to-talk-about-testing/" target="_blank">https://dannorth.net/2021/07/26/we-need-to-talk-about-testing/</a></li><li>To summarise: TDD, BDD, ATDD, and related methods categorically do not replace testing, whatever their names may suggest. They are primarily design and development techniques.,<li>The purpose of testing is to increase confidence for stakeholders through evidence.  ,<li>Shifting left on testing means thinking about architecture and design differently, considering different stakeholders early and continually. Which in turn means shifting left on security, accessibility, and all the other dimensions of quality that we should care about. So shifting left on testing motivates all kinds of assurance activities, which can stop us over-investing in a solution that was never going to work. It is like TDD on steroids.</ul><hr />
<h2>Henry Rollins’ Iron and the Soul, Brett, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-31 19:00:26: I believe that the definition of definition is reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself. When I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, was a product of all the fear and humiliation I suffered. Fear of my parents. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/henry-rollins-iron-and-soul/" target="_blank">https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/henry-rollins-iron-and-soul/</a></li><li>I have never met a truly strong person who didn’t have self-respect.

<h2>Agile at 20: The Failed Rebellion, Al Tenhundfeld, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-31 14:07:35: The Agile Manifesto turned 20 this year, and there are two facts that seem self-evident: Agile, as a label, won; nobody wants to be called non-Agile. Agile, as it is practiced, falls woefully short of the revolutionary ideas of its founders. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.simplethread.com/agile-at-20-the-failed-rebellion/" target="_blank">https://www.simplethread.com/agile-at-20-the-failed-rebellion/</a></li><li>Scrum was invented to function in hostile environments. It’s a contract between hard-pushing managers and developers needing time to think and explore.,<li>It turns out that prioritizing individuals and interactions is a hard concept to sell. It’s much easier to sell processes and tools. It turns out that working software is harder to produce than unrealistic plans and reams of documentation. It turns out that collaborating with customers requires trust and vulnerability, not always present in a business setting. It turns out that responding to change often gets outweighed by executives wanting to feel in control and still legitimately needing to make long-term plans for their businesses.,<li>They weren’t project managers or CTOs or VP Engs. They were developers, programmers, scientists, and engineers. They were still slingin’ code* and working with their stakeholders to solve problems. This is important. </ul><hr />
<h2>It’s not what you think, The Next Ten, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-31 11:34:14: Chris Cornell died early Thursday morning. His band Soundgarden played a show on Wednesday night at the Fox Theater in Detroit. Two hours after the show ended, he was gone. For two days, I’ve been working on a piece to pay tribute to him, and it’s been a struggle. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://thefirsttenwords.wordpress.com/2018/05/31/its-not-what-you-think/" target="_blank">https://thefirsttenwords.wordpress.com/2018/05/31/its-not-what-you-think/</a></li><li>You might think grunge is about anger, but that’s not completely true. Yes, it can sound that way, but it’s really about depression and cynicism. Those two go hand-in-hand, along with their nasty little sister, anxiety. When the three of them get going, they just eat hope as quickly as it can be summoned. That leaves despair and despair is exhausting, not just for those who experience it, but for the people around it as well. So we keep it to ourselves because we don’t want to be a burden. And then it gets to be too much.,<li>It’s possible that, along with grunge, Generation X’s other great gift to society is depression. I mean, of course it was here long before the Baby Boomers started re-producing, but we talk about it more than those who came before us. We talk about it as a demon or a monster. It’s a dark shadow that shows itself at any point in time without warning. It surrounds us, isolates us, and quiets us. Depression likes to blame things. We feel like shit because of mistakes we have made in life or because of the state of the world or because we aren’t perfect. Without a lot of help and a lot of work, it’s impossible to know that it really is a chemical imbalance in our brains. After twenty-plus years of trying to de-stigmatize depression, some of us still have a hard time recognizing it for what it is. And even then, it doesn’t always matter.</ul><hr />
<h2>Hunter S. Thompson’s Letter on Finding Your Purpose and Living a Meaningful Life, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-31 11:05:30: In April of 1958, Hunter S. Thompson was 22 years old when he wrote this letter to his friend Hume Logan in response to a request for life advice. Thompson’s letter, found in Letters of Note, offers some of the most thoughtful and profound advice I’ve ever come across. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://fs.blog/2014/05/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/" target="_blank">https://fs.blog/2014/05/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/</a></li><li>The answer— and, in a sense, the tragedy of life— is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It’s not the fireman who has changed, but you. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.,<li>beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life. But you say, “I don’t know where to look; I don’t know what to look for.” ,<li>As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES.</ul><hr />
<h2>Henry Rollins on defining success, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-31 10:48:07: I don’t know if I’ve ever had one. I’m not trying to say I’m somebody with a volcanic output coming out of me all the time, but if somebody ever says, “Well, what do you do about writer’s block?” I’m like, “I don’t think I’m a writer. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/henry-rollins-on-defining-success/" target="_blank">https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/henry-rollins-on-defining-success/</a></li><li>But, I do try to write 1,000 words a day. It’s just like going to the gym. ,<li>I think it’s important if you’re a creative person, or aspire to be, that you don’t spend too much time aspiring or asking advice. Just get going and address what’s roaring inside you. </ul><hr />
<h2>Technical Debt Is Not Debt; It’s Not Even Technical, grevillemark, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-30 19:41:53: Co-authored with Dr Paidi O’Raghallaigh and Dr Stephen McCarthy at Cork University Business School as part of my PhD studies, and originally published by Cutter Consortium’s Business Agility & Software Engineering Excellence practice on 22nd of July 2021 Take a minute and write an answer to the </aside><ul><li><a href="https://markgreville.ie/2021/07/23/technical-debt-is-not-debt-its-not-even-technical/" target="_blank">https://markgreville.ie/2021/07/23/technical-debt-is-not-debt-its-not-even-technical/</a></li><li>A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite.

<h2>Building a Vision of Life Without Work, livafi, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-30 18:28:38: The number one question that people ask once you tell them you’re considering early retirement is:  What will you do with your time?

<h2>On working too hard: finding balance, and lessons learned from others, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-30 18:27:12: One of those “unpopular opinion” tweets went wild recently, kicking up a storm of people responding on both sides of the fence. Unpopular opinion: the best thing young people can do early in their careers is to work on the weekends. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/working-too-hard/" target="_blank">https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/working-too-hard/</a></li><li>Ensuring you could be fully present in whatever you were doing was clearly important to him, and I’ve found this a healthy goal to balance against getting too into work.,<li>Doing this might help you work more, but it may permanently impact your ability to enjoy yourself outside of work. This type of mental trick is addictive, and it alters your perception of normal, developing a need to work that is disconnected from your personal goals. It’s more than developing a habit, it’s building an addiction. There is a risk of losing your ability to be present and enjoy your life when you’re not at a desk making ‘progress’. </ul><hr />
<h2>Evil tip: avoid "easy" things, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-29 18:57:23: Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb. Evildoers live longer and feel better. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://yosefk.com/blog/evil-tip-avoid-easy-things.html" target="_blank">http://yosefk.com/blog/evil-tip-avoid-easy-things.html</a></li><li>The guy working on the "hard" thing gets a lot of help and resources, making it easier to succeed – and easier to move on to the next "hard" thing. The guy doing the "easy" tasks gets no help, so it's harder to succeed. ,<li>One thing you want to prevent is people learning to remind you earlier. The way to accomplish it is being very nice when they come late. If people feel punished for reminding too late, they'll come earlier next time, and in a vengeful mood, so with more needless tasks. But if they're late and you eagerly "try to do the best under the circumstances", not only do you put yourself under the spotlight as a patriotic hero, you move the forgetful culprit out of the spotlight. So they'll form a rosy memory of the incident, and not learn the value of coming earlier – precisely what we want.,<li>Urgent things automatically become harder, a person in a hurry more important. The later it's done, the easier it is to get help (while retaining the status of "the" hero in the center of it all who made it happen.) Under time pressure, the scope shrinks, making the formerly "easy" and now officially "hard" thing genuinely easier. This is particularly useful for the really disgusting, but unavoidable work</ul><hr />
<h2>How to Work Hard, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-29 18:46:57: It might not seem there's much to learn about how to work hard. Anyone who's been to school knows what it entails, even if they chose not to. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hwh.html" target="_blank">http://www.paulgraham.com/hwh.html</a></li><li>Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It's a complicated, dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind you're best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you can, accurately judge at each moment both what you're capable of and how you're doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can without harming the quality of the result. This network is too complicated to trick. But if you're consistently honest and clear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and you'll be productive in a way few people are.      ,<li>The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously from one person to another. That's one of the most important things I've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is figure out what it is. That's how it works in movies, and in the streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly from one kind of work to another.,<li>The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate a sensitivity to the quality of the work you're doing, and then you'll notice if it decreases because you're working too hard. Honesty is critical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you're being lazy, but also when you're working too hard. And if you think there's something admirable about working too hard, get that idea out of your head. </ul><hr />
<h2>Friday Facts #366 - The only way to go fast, is to go well!, kovarex, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-29 18:10:53: We obviously have a lot to talk about when it comes to the game changes we recently did, or plan to do, but we don't want to share any of it yet.

And this is exactly what happens with code that has a good and expandable design from the start.,<li>one of his main roles was making sure that any discovered bug is first covered by a test before it gets actually fixed, and generally improving our code test coverage. This made the releases much more confident, and we had less regression bugs, which directly transitions into long-term efficiency. I strongly believe that this clearly indicates and supports what Uncle bob is saying. Working with tests feels slower but it is actually faster.</ul><hr />

<h2>Don’t Feed the Thought Leaders, Adam Gordon Bell, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-29 13:41:21: Here is a somewhat fictionalized personal story. I’ve changed the names of the people and the technology used. I was a new engineering manager whose team was starting a new small but ambitious project at a SAAS company. The company had several hundred developers, and the project was approved. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/thought-leaders/" target="_blank">https://earthly.dev/blog/thought-leaders/</a></li><li>Tetlock’s talk on this is subtitled “Ignore Confident Forecasters,” which I think is an excellent summary of his findings.,<li>Still, there is some evidence that noncontingent, one-big-idea advice is less valuable than more nuanced, complicated advice.,<li>Thankfully, not all the advice I received was bad. One person, in particular, asked very pointed questions about the problems be solved and identified some potential blind spots in our plan. They also offered a great tip for dealing with advice that didn’t seem relevant to the project’s success: Create an extended product roadmap and put those items at least a year off into the future “and as long as they don’t seem relevant, you can just keep pushing them into the future.” Perversely this plan made everyone happy – everyone’s feedback is on the roadmap, and now it’s all just a question of priorities. </ul><hr />
<h2>Being a Tech Lead in an Empowered Product Team, 2021</h2><aside>2021-07-13 06:37:56: Being a tech lead in an empowered product team is not a purely technical role.

Yet it’s foundational to clarifying your thinking, because this is where it all begins: with a moment of self-reflection. Without pauses, there can be no second thoughts and no self-interrogations. There is no process until you take the time to embark upon it. You might think that this point is too obvious to be worth making. Yet, in my experience, it’s where most of us fall down. We all carry around countless unclear, confused, contradictory thoughts and feelings. And precisely because we have neither the time nor the tools to sort them out, they mostly stay this way. Once you’ve paused, a common psychotherapeutic exercise can help you take a first step towards clearer thinking. It’s about observing yourself as neutrally as possible.

If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to the 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences. In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html" target="_blank">http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html</a></li><li>People who don't look any deeper than the Gini coefficient,<li>Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders' stock. The value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth rate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion dollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when it reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower. That's why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The low initial cost of starting a startup means founders can start young, and the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeed they could be surprisingly rich just a few years later.</ul><hr />
<h2>Everyone Is Still Terrible At Creating Software At Scale, mikiobraun, 2021</h2><aside>2021-04-30 05:25:42: There is something peculiar about software that makes it different from other crafts.

They provide basic infrastructure like roads, electricity, buildings, shop space you can rent, and now Internet. Some of these pieces of infrastructure change very slowly (like roads), while others are much more flexible, like the way apartments or shops are used. What if software were built in the same way? What if the core parts of our business would be like streets, and all that newfangled stuff is something we could build on top, experiment, tear it down if it does not work? I’ve seen a few e-commerce companies from the inside, and while their systems are marvel of technologies able to handle thousands of transactions per second, it does not feel like this, but things like the app and the website are very deeply entangled with the rest.

So you would typically start from an empty program and construct it step by step, often by importing existing well-tested parts that you see elsewhere. ,<li>The problem really only becomes apparent as you try to solve it. So, the key thing is to quickly iterate.,<li>that a large part of problem solving is actually precisely understanding the problem. Most problems that you face are ill-defined and open to interpretation. And when solving problems that are not inherently ill-defined, you often find better solutions by treating them as such!,<li>A typical form of what you call specification in our world is a bit more like a design brief. A much more space is dedicated to the context in which the work is happening, the problem that you are trying to solve and constraints that you are facing, but design briefs say very little about any specific potential software solution to the problem. ,<li> the creation of software as a design activity, putting it as a third item on the same level as science and art.,<li>When you're solving a problem, even as you get to a more technical level, you always keep in mind why you are solving it.

It is embedded in people and in the products they build, but it is not clear how you could turn such knowledge into a textbook.,<li>So, you cannot learn software design from a textbook then?  That's right. Knowledge about design is hard to externalize. It is embedded in people and in the products they build, but it is not clear how you could turn such knowledge into a textbook.

Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.,<li>One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how well it's worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't prestigious.

      Prerequisites), including developer effectiveness. Sometimes teams

      developer effectiveness because they do not invest in maintaining fast
      feedback loops. This is a very common situation my company runs into.

      flow, there is research that indicates  it can
      take up to 23 minutes to get back into the state of flow and return to high

How can I apply this knowledge that I learned?
How do these ideas relate to what I already know?,<li>Make it time-based, take regular breaks, and learn what you’re curious about.
,<li>But the purpose of this “picture walk” reading is different; it’s to catch my curiosity. And curiosity is different from understanding because it’s either happens or not. It’s like you’re seeing a pretty girl; you don’t really sit and reason, “well, do I really like her?”,<li>By taking just 10 minutes a day to quickly scroll through the book instead of my Twitter feed, I end up having 365 books scrolled in a year. From these 365, about two end up being life-changing, ten – deeply interesting, and ten – sort of interesting. Everything else is noise. 94%.
Now, do the math. If I didn’t have this discovery routine and aimed to read books from cover to cover, I’d randomly sample about twenty books from 365 with meager chances of all of them being good. And I was doing that for years. So don’t repeat my mistake and invest 5-10 minutes a day to discover what you learn from, because learning is like eating. You become what you consume.,<li>.

Folks in the kitchen call it metacognition, which means thinking about thinking. Metacognition is the single best trick I’ve found to improve understanding, and I will write more about it in the future.

It just feels so strange to experience that cognitive load again.,<li>So much of what we call creativity and intelligence is just memory. If you think you can look it up on Google, you’re wrong.

Also, the most interesting ideas come when you’re not at your desk but showering, glazing over stars or wandering around in the city center. When you can’t Google.

<h2>No Meetings, No Deadlines, No Full-Time Employees, 2021</h2><aside>2021-01-07 15:22:00: I started Gumroad in 2011. In 2015, we reached a peak of 23 full-time employees. In 2016, after failing to raise more money, I ended up back where I began: a one-person company. Today, when I’m asked how many people work at Gumroad, I respond with “ten or so. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://sahillavingia.com/work" target="_blank">https://sahillavingia.com/work</a></li><li>We also have an “anti-overtime” rate: past twenty hours a week, people can continue to work at an hourly rate of 50 percent. This allows us to have a high hourly rate for the highest leverage work and also allows people to work more per week if they wish.
,<li>Because I was burned out and didn’t want to think about working any more than I needed to, I instituted a no-meeting, no-deadline culture.
For me, it was no longer about growth at all costs, but “freedom at all costs.”</ul><hr />
<h2>Billionaires Build, 2021</h2><aside>2021-01-04 13:16:26: As I was deciding what to write about next, I was surprised to find that two separate essays I'd been planning to write were actually the same.

That may seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggest flaw in most startup ideas.,<li>If I had to decide whether to fund startups based on a single question, it would be "How do you know people want this?",<li>The ideal combination is the group of founders who are "living in the future" in the sense of being at the leading edge of some kind of change, and who are building something they themselves want.,<li>Competitors are rarely what kills startups. Poor execution does.,<li>They're usually doing it from some combination of the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine interest in the problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else.,<li>What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group of users and can make what they want. This is so important that it's YC's motto: "Make something people want."

<h2>Boundaries and Infinities: A Post about Responsibility, 2021</h2><aside>2021-01-04 12:46:20: This post is a sequel to my Role Shapes post from last year. Like that post, this post is about a metaphor for working on a team, and talks about each of us as shapes in a space of work that gets done. This year, I’m talking about a slightly different space. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://madeofmetaphors.com/boundaries-and-infinities" target="_blank">http://madeofmetaphors.com/boundaries-and-infinities</a></li><li>Her shape on that diagram, then, represents all those responsibilities. Emily’s shape is finite: it is bounded on all sides. It doesn't shoot off into infinity. And all the adjacent shapes are other people’s roles. ,<li>The challenges Paul faces are the challenges of a man faced with infinite potential and limited time. And to succeed, he’ll need vision, personal talent, discipline, confidence, and decisiveness.,<li>Paul has a team, now, and they look to him for management and counsel. They’re mostly finite shapes, so they need a manager who can tell them about political savvy and nuance and help them develop the skills of working within their constrained roles but still having an impact.
But Paul doesn't know how to do any of that. He knows how to forge ahead and make big decisions and push on things so they get done. And none of those are appropriate behaviors for his new team members.,<li>The way you avoid waste in small organizations is by staying lean and not wasting time with politics. In larger organizations, it’s almost the opposite: you avoid waste by respecting the boundary lines between shapes and navigating them with nuanced coordination, communication, and management, none of which are usually strengths for people like Paul, who got to where he did precisely because he thrives when there aren't boundary lines.,<li>To succeed, the skills she’ll need include discipline and personal talent for the production work, of course, but moreover she’ll need the political savvy and social skills to navigate the boundaries between her shape and others’ with nuance,<li>Those boundaries are dark black lines in the diagrams, but in reality they’re much fuzzier – they have to be fluid. And when you are in a role like Emily’s, the fluidity at the boundary is the most interesting part. That example is a simple one, too. They get far more complicated:,<li>People like Paul, when they give advice, often focus on personal effectiveness, alpha behavior, and triage, and deride or overlook the importance of management, coordination, and “overhead.” They are allergic to process and overhead because for small companies, that’s the right way to be. It takes tremendous self-awareness, humility, and flexibility for people in Paul’s situation to internalize the changes intrinsic to a growing company and develop that new skill set,<li>People in privileged positions who don’t understand the importance of relationship-building and nuance in larger organizations end up marauding through situations and leaving them even worse off, all the while thinking they’re being highly effective.,<li>Because his tenure makes him the 800lb gorilla, but people in Paul’s situation can be surprisingly oblivious to this. Often, Paul doesn't understand why other people don’t just behave like he does. After all, it works for him!,<li> 
Paul’s shape is infinite – if you keep zooming out, it keeps going. There are no boundaries at the edges. Paul’s responsibilities look like this:
Decide what needs to be done.
Do all of it.,<li>In terms of the visual metaphor, the difference between them is that Emily’s shape is finite and Paul’s is infinite. A finite shape has a finite list of responsibilities, and the nuance is in the fractal intricacy of its boundary with all the other shapes. An infinite shape’s responsibilities end with “et cetera”, and the nuance is in triage: The shape is infinite, but the person occupying it is finite.
The interesting part is when conditions change.</ul><hr />
<h2>How to Stop Endless Discussions, 2021</h2><aside>2021-01-03 15:24:55: I often see people believe in their solution and think theirs are better than the others'. They defend their cases without having an exact reason. These situations often create long and meaningless discussions that go nowhere. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://candost.blog/how-to-stop-endless-discussions/" target="_blank">https://candost.blog/how-to-stop-endless-discussions/</a></li><li>We used the NABC model from Stanford. The model starts with defining the Need, followed by Approach, Benefits, and lastly, Competitors. Separating the Need from the approach is very smart. While writing the need, the authors have to understand it very well. The approach and benefits sections are pretty straightforward, where authors define their strategy and list down the advantages.,<li>The RFC process uses a document written by someone about their proposal on a topic. It has a specific timeframe and everyone can give feedback on it. The RFC and feedbacks are posted publicly. Everyone can join the discussion. The goal is to include as many people as possible to access more points of view and spread the knowledge simultaneously. The good thing is that people focus on the proposed idea and give their feedback based on facts instead of only beliefs. On the other hand, it has a way bigger effect.,<li>These hidden gems of writing the idea in a structured way and asking people for comments afterward prevents many endless debates,<li>The process seeks a consent-based environment, not a consensus-based one. If some people care about a topic a lot and come up with a written document that explains many things in detail, everyone can (and should) trust them. The authors shouldn't wait for everyone's confirmation of their proposal. When they get enough feedback, they should be able to continue further with or abandon the idea. It's their decision. Since they prepared the doc and collected many comments on it, they can have a better judgment.,<li>That's why we need to balance both taking action and asking people to present their opinion on a topic. This balance is achievable with an excellent process.  
I helped build this balanced process in an organization where we aimed to solve another problem - the lack of feedback. We introduced a process called Request For Comments (RFC). It is a common feedback mechanism in the software world presented by the Internet Society (ISOC) and used currently in the Rust language</ul><hr />
<h2>Difficult Conversations, 2021</h2><aside>2021-01-03 09:42:15: I had a post written about difficult conversations. It was quite reasonable. Then I read this article by Clayton Christensen on the Harvard Business Review, and specifically this quote: "Management is the most noble of professions if it’s practiced well. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://madeofmetaphors.com/difficult-conversations" target="_blank">http://madeofmetaphors.com/difficult-conversations</a></li><li>How do you know when you should have a difficult conversation? Obviously you shouldn't berate people constantly just because you believe they could be doing a tiny bit better. Let's say you have someone who's doing fine, could probably be doing more, but when you probe a bit, seems totally content. Just mention to him the options - "If you ever want to do more, we can talk about that" - and leave it at that. He doesn't have a problem. Don't project your impatience onto people. But if you have someone who's not succeeding and wants to be, or who clearly wants to do more and is being held back by limitations he doesn't understand or believe, that's a dissonance. Dissonance is a signal that you need to have a difficult conversation,<li>If you're afraid of difficult conversations, only having difficult conversations will make you less afraid. And second, it gets better. Have those difficult conversations and the fear will recede. I promise.,<li>The key part of a difficult conversation is being in touch with the proper intention when you go into it. In a nutshell, that intention is this: I am telling you these observations I have made even though it is difficult for me because I care about you and believe they may help you learn and grow.
Here are a few notable things that aren't part of that intention: I expect you to take this advice. My observations are absolutely correct. I am personally attached to the outcome. I know better than you do what's appropriate for you. I'm telling you this because I want you to see me as smart. I'm telling you this because I like identifying as a "mentor" or "teacher" or "wise person."</ul><hr />

<h2>What Shape are You?, 2021</h2><aside>2021-01-01 13:47:07: My post before this was a kind of therapy / Buddhism / personal growth kind of deal, but I also spend a lot of time thinking about how to run effective teams and to be a responsible, thoughtful manager of people. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://madeofmetaphors.com/shapes" target="_blank">https://madeofmetaphors.com/shapes</a></li><li>But at higher levels, there's just too much to spell it all out. It's important to try, to define boundaries for that shape so you have some way to talk about them, but you can't capture all of it in full detail. It relies on a mutual understanding about implied work.
Some work yields knowledge that you need to do other work, and so a viable role that does one of these things must do the other.,<li>If you're in charge of writing some code, you also have to comment it, because if you don't, nobody else will understand it well enough to do it for you. If you're in charge of coming up with a creative direction for a project, you also need to communicate it outwards to others, because if you don't, nobody else knows enough to do it for you.
,<li>As you get more senior, maybe you're a specialist, so your shape gets bigger and the boundary remains nice and clear. Or you end up as a lead, and you're able to fill spaces in the project and pick up slack that few others can, so your boundary gets messier,<li>These diagrams I'm drawing fundamentally express project development as a subtractive process: you start with a mountain of stuff to get done, and by the time you're done, someone will have done all of it. These diagrams visualize the abstract notion that there's "all the work" and each person subtracts some of it from the space, and you're done when everything has been subtracted.
But not all work is subtractive. Consider a factory worker assembling cars. If he assembles 2 cars in a day, he makes the company a profit; if he works harder and assembles 4 cars in a day, he makes the company twice as much. This is an additive sort of work. You can do the same work, but just more of it, and you generate more value.
Creative endeavors are not additive. They are iterative, convergent processes, and so they are subtractive: you work until you have converged, and then you stop.,<li>During conversations about performance, everything you talk about should boil down to one thing: the value they contribute to the team. What is their value, and how can they become more valuable?,<li>And to managers, I'd say: when you talk to your reports, help them think about their work and everyone's work as subtractive, as cutting out shapes from the big space of all work. Tell them what things are clearly theirs, and talk about those with whom they share boundaries, and what those boundaries should be. Talk about imperatives: tell them what kinds of problems you foresee and what roles you see them playing in the solutions. Talk about the whole project, even the stuff they'd never otherwise hear about - especially that stuff. Give them context. Talk about convergence. Help them see their shapes.</ul><hr />
<h2>My favorite essays of life advice, 2020</h2><aside>2020-12-31 01:49:43: I start each of my weekly reviews by re-reading one of my favorite essays of life advice—a different one each week.

Most people want to believe what they learn is the truth: there are a few people who doubt everything. If you believe too much then you are not likely to find the essentially new view that transforms a field, and if you doubt too much you will not be able to do much at all. It is a fine balance between believing what you learn and at the same time doubting things. Great steps forward usually involve a change of viewpoint to outside the standard ones in the field.</ul><hr />
<h2>Systems design explains the world: volume 1, 2020</h2><aside>2020-12-29 01:18:41: "Systems design" is a branch of study that tries to find universal architectural patterns that are valid across disciplines.

<h2>Validation is a mirage, Jason Fried, 2020</h2><aside>2020-12-27 03:10:09: Spend enough time talking with entrepreneurs, product people, designers, and anyone charged with proving something, and you’ll bump into questions about validation. You can’t. You can’t. You can’t. You can’t. You can’t. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/validation-is-a-mirage/" target="_blank">https://m.signalvnoise.com/validation-is-a-mirage/</a></li><li>If you want to see if something works, make it. The whole thing. The simplest version of the whole thing – that’s what version 1.0 is supposed to be. But make that, put it out there, and learn. If you want answers, you have to ask the question, and the question is: Market, what do you think of this completed version 1.0 of our product?
,<li>When I hear MVP, I don’t think Minimum Viable Product. I think Minimum Viable Pie. The food kind.
A slice of pie is all you need to evaluate the whole pie. It’s homogenous. But that’s not how products work. Products are a collection of interwoven parts, one dependent on another, one leading to another, one integrating with another. You can’t take a slice a product, ask people how they like it, and deduce they’ll like the rest of the product once you’ve completed it. All you learn is that they like or don’t like the slice you gave them.,<li>Truth is, you don’t know, you won’t know, you’ll never know until you know and reflect back on something real. And the best way to find out, is to believe in it, make it, and put it out there. You do your best, you promote it the best you can, you prepare yourself the best way you know how. And then you literally cross your fingers. I’m not kidding.
You can’t validate something that doesn’t exist. You can’t validate an idea. You can’t validate someone’s guess. You can’t validate an abstraction. You can’t validate a sketch, or a wireframe, or an MVP that isn’t the actual product.</ul><hr />

<h2>How to be indistractable, Nir Eyal, 2020</h2><aside>2020-12-22 08:30:05: Stop blaming technology – distraction starts within.

I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, I’d become the disciplined writer and focused father I’d always strived to be.
Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. ‘Hmmm,’ I said to myself, ‘I really should take a glance at this book’. I’d justify the distraction as necessary for ‘research’. And if it wasn’t reading, then I’d find something else – the laundry that needed to be folded right now, my desk that needed to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasn’t distracting me. I was distracting me.,<li>Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something,<li>I discovered that I was just as susceptible to being distracted by a news report or a dirty closet as I was by a glowing screen. Does that mean I cut out the news, or let my closets go? No. It meant having to figure out what I was avoiding (writing) and why I was avoiding it (all the writerly anxieties) and then dealing with those. It also meant building systems to manage my time, attention and internet use.</ul><hr />

<h2>How to Think for Yourself, 2020</h2><aside>2020-12-13 23:43:36: There are some kinds of work that you can't do well without thinking differently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for example, it's not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be both correct and novel. You can't publish papers saying things other people already know. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/think.html" target="_blank">http://paulgraham.com/think.html</a></li><li>The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert: fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to fill it.
Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one another in much the same way muscles can. If you're sufficiently fastidious about truth, you don't need to be as resistant to being told what to think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps in your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity, because if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiosity can compensate for them: if you're sufficiently curious, you don't need to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discover will push out the conventional ones you acquired by default.,<li>One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs are. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and make more effort to find out.,<li>You don't want to start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea, or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but that you know isn't like writing software for a tiny computer used by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people rent airbeds on strangers' floors.
Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already knew would be boring. You have to tell them something new.</ul><hr />

When you turn on a tap, you don’t need to have requested there to be water in the pipes first. The companies that manage the water supply handle the complexity.,<li>Complexity is like energy. It cannot be created or destroyed, only moved somewhere else. When a product or service becomes simpler for users, engineers and designers have to work harder. Norman writes, “With technology, simplifications at the level of usage invariably result in added complexity of the underlying mechanism. ” For example, the files and folders conceptual model for computer interfaces doesn’t change how files are stored, but by putting in extra work to translate the process into something recognizable, designers make navigating them easier for users.</ul><hr />
<h2>Early Work, 2020</h2><aside>2020-10-25 11:07:55: One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an irrational one.

It has always happened, but till the last few centuries it happened so slowly as to be invisible to individual humans. And since we didn't need customs for dealing with new ideas, we didn't develop any.
We just don't have enough experience with early versions of ambitious projects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we would judge more finished work, or less ambitious projects. We don't realize they're a special case.</ul><hr />

<h2>Systems thinking for startups, 2020</h2><aside>2020-10-05 09:57:29: Peter Senge has been called the most influential business strategists of the century and in my view Senge is the successor of Peter Drucker, the management visionary. Senge published a book in 1990 called The Fifth Discipline which I think every manager, founder and CEO should read. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.tomtunguz.com/learning-organizations/" target="_blank">https://www.tomtunguz.com/learning-organizations/</a></li><li>The systems viewpoint is generally oriented toward the long-term view. That’s why delays and feedback loops are so important. In the short term, you can often ignore them; they’re inconsequential. They only come back to haunt you in the long term.


				
				
				
				
			
		
		
		
	,<li>Thus, we may cut our advertising budgets, see the benefits in terms of cost savings, and in turn further trim spending in this area. In the short run there may be little impact on people’s demands for our goods and services, but longer term the decline in visibility may have severe penalties. An appreciation of systems will lead to recognition of the use of, and problems with, such reinforcing feedback, and also an understanding of the place of balancing (or stabilizing) feedback.

<h2>On Being Bipolar, Andrea Bennett, 2020</h2><aside>2020-10-05 09:48:43: Sometime in my mid-to-late twenties, less than a decade after I’d been diagnosed bipolar II, I participated in a study that sought to glean insights from “high-functioning” bipolar people—presumably to figure out why we were high functioning and if anything we had to share could help others </aside><ul><li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/on-being-bipolar/" target="_blank">https://thewalrus.ca/on-being-bipolar/</a></li><li>I don’t dream about not being bipolar, because I don’t know where my self ends and where the illness begins—and if there is even really a difference. And I don’t know what I would dream to render the divisions between good sick and bad sick unnecessary, to make it so that we all get to remain people, without sacrificing some of us to quarantine and cautionary tale.</ul><hr />
<h2>Marc Andreessen On Productivity, Scheduling, Reading Habits, Work, and More, Marc Andreessen,Sriram Krishnan, 2020</h2><aside>2020-09-21 12:18:07: This interview was recorded earlier this year and originally appeared on The Observer Effect; it has only been lightly edited for formatting here. Let’s get into it. Over a decade ago, you wrote a famous post called the ‘Pmarca guide to productivity‘. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/09/07/on-productivity-scheduling-reading-habits-marc-andreessen/" target="_blank">https://a16z.com/2020/09/07/on-productivity-scheduling-reading-habits-marc-andreessen/</a></li><li>It’s basically trying to try to fill in all the puzzle pieces for the big discrepancies.A great term is “sense-making”. Essentially, what the hell is happening and why? The world’s an incredibly complex and erratic place and trying to figure that out is kind of a lifetime occupation.,<li>the D.R.I. For any project, I’ve tried to identify the DRI. Who is the person responsible for delivering the project? If that’s me, then the project itself gets on my calendar.,<li>The firm is built to accomplish what I want to accomplish. And then my role here is to accomplish that within the context of the firm. And so the short answer is always the same — how do we optimize for the success of the firm? For the projects the firm is involved in, how do I optimize my contribution to that? So, you know, it’s been the same answer to the question every year for 11 years in a row and I don’t think it’ll change anytime soon. I think it’s more of trying to tune against a single goal as compared to trying to rethink the goals.</ul><hr />
<h2>Being OK With Not Being Extraordinary, 2020</h2><aside>2020-09-21 03:20:44: The internet always highlights the first place winners, the billionaires, the award-winning artists, the best-selling authors, the largest philanthropists, the extraordinary. Their stories are ones of success, of inspiration. They show us what is possible, and push us to achieve more. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://tiffanymatthe.com/not-extraordinary" target="_blank">https://tiffanymatthe.com/not-extraordinary</a></li><li>But real extraordinary is nothing like this. Yes, it's exciting, but it also comes with sacrifices, limitations, and constraints. And it's not permanent. Extraordinary can disappear over time, just like you can achieve it over time.</ul><hr />
<h2>If it's a Nice Problem to Have, Don't Solve it Now, 2020</h2><aside>2020-08-11 03:10:56: When building a product from scratch you need to do a lot of hard things all at once, with limited resources. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://davnicwil.com/if-its-a-nice-problem-to-have-dont-solve-it-now" target="_blank">https://davnicwil.com/if-its-a-nice-problem-to-have-dont-solve-it-now</a></li><li>An example to illustrate is signup functionality. Let's say I'm starting on a new product. Without signup, there's no possibility of getting any users, which is a problem. From my perspective right now, is this a nice problem to have? No - I have zero users right now, and can't get any until signup is done. The only way to move forwards is to build signup.</ul><hr />
<h2>Misunderstanding "Skin in the Game", Alex Danco, 2020</h2><aside>2020-08-06 08:41:01: As the dog days of summer stretch on, I’ve been doing a lot of trail running to keep active. The east end of Toronto is home to a spectacular and unsanctioned, semi-secret network of mountain biking trails that line the river valley ravines. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://danco.substack.com/p/misunderstanding-skin-in-the-game" target="_blank">https://danco.substack.com/p/misunderstanding-skin-in-the-game</a></li><li>Upside incentive can matter a great deal, but it has almost nothing to do with skin in the game the way that Taleb uses the phrase. When Taleb talks about “Skin in the game”, he’s talking about survival. A small business owner does not have SitG because she’s incentivized to run her business well; she has SitG because if she doesn’t run her business well, then it doesn’t stick around. ,<li>just raise less money! It’ll force you to work harder, learner, and smarter, and it’ll force you to get things right faster, or run out of cash trying. But I’ll bet you that’s not what these people have in mind.,<li>The core, unifying theme across all of Taleb's writing - from his early work around randomness and The Black Swan through later works like Antifragility and Skin in the Game - is the logic of risk-taking. Taleb takes great offence at creating work, exercise, or any other kind of activity that’s designed to consciously offload risk from the participant; he’s particularly fond of complaining about elliptical machines at the gym, jogging, or really any kind of exercise that isn’t free weight deadlifting. But I have a distinct feeling that he would be willing to make an exception for trail running, which seems like it’d be a lot more in his ballpark.</ul><hr />
<h2>Attention is your scarcest resource, 2020</h2><aside>2020-08-04 00:10:27: Like many people, I have most of my best ideas in the shower. This is sometimes annoying: I could use more than one shower’s worth of good ideas a day, but I’d rather not end up as a shrivelled yet insightful prune. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/attention/" target="_blank">https://www.benkuhn.net/attention/</a></li><li>Monotask
As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I’d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.
In the short term, this made me less efficient, because I’d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for long enough, I’d eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner’s API in a fit of rage. This resulted in me shipping my most important projects faster, hence getting faster compounding growth.</ul><hr />

<h2>Remote work is a platform, Jason Fried, 2020</h2><aside>2020-07-28 12:07:08: Back in the mid-90s, just as Netscape Navigator was giving us our first look at what the visual internet could be, web design came in two flavors. There was the ultra basic stuff. Text on a page, maybe a masthead graphic of some sort. Nothing sophisticated. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/remote-work-is-a-platform/" target="_blank">https://m.signalvnoise.com/remote-work-is-a-platform/</a></li><li>No one knew what to make of the web at that time, so we pulled over things we were familiar with and sunk them in place. At that time, Web design wasn’t web design – it was print design, multimedia/interactive design, and graphic design. It took years for native web design to come into its own.,<li>They’ll have stopped trying to make remote look like local. They’ll have discovered that remote work means more autonomy, more trust, more uninterrupted stretches of time, smaller teams, more independent, concurrent work (and less dependent, sequenced work)</ul><hr />
<h2>Antifragility, 2020</h2><aside>2020-07-28 11:43:11: Upon request, I feel like I ought to explain some of these misunderstandings. I already wrote one a few months back on misunderstanding “skin in the game” (it’s not an incentive; it’s a filter). This week we’ll tackle another one: antifragility. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/03/12/antifragility/" target="_blank">https://alexdanco.com/2020/03/12/antifragility/</a></li><li>In a fragile system, that stressor creates uncertainty. You had a plan, and you were good to follow that plan so long as you stayed within a certain state. But now you’re thrown into a new state, so your plan no longer works. You’re in trouble. That’s fragility.
In a robust system, that stressor is information-neutral. You had a plan, and there’s enough buffer or slack in your system to absorb the stressor. Your state is resilient to the new challenge; the plan continues.
In an antifragile system, that stressor resolves uncertainty. You had no preexisting plan; the stressor tells you what to do. In an antifragile system, stressors are information. Without stressors, an antifragile system is rudderless. It doesn’t know how to grow or what to do. It actively suffers, until a challenge gives it direction.,<li>Accordingly, antifragile systems and organisms tend towards a common theme: bottoms-up decision-making, rather than top-down decision making. Antifragility requires real options, and real options are low-cost. Antifragility is only successful if you can actually detect, react, and grow in response to deviations from your present state in real time; the only way you can feasibly do this is for disorder detection and response to take place at a small enough resolution, and tight enough turnaround time. Top-down systems have a hard time with antifragility, because for them, all options are costly. ,<li>Antifragility is something you do, rather than something you have or something you are. Antifragility is an operating state of growing through continuous reaction. It’s like the opposite of predicting the future. You’re not making any forward-looking assumptions about anything, but you need disorder: you need a state change to have something to react to. Good antifragile systems react quickly and correctly, like the Hydra growing new heads when you cut one off. Without disorder, the Hydra doesn’t grow.

<h2>Looking Back on Four Years at The Times, Nick Rockwell, 2020</h2><aside>2020-06-21 01:30:36: A month ago, after four years and a quarter as CTO, I left The New York Times. It was an amazing four years, and I want to take a moment to capture some of what we accomplished, and some of what I learned in the process.

<h2>Solving online events, Benedict Evans, 2020</h2><aside>2020-06-06 02:16:55: Online events remind me a lot of ecommerce in about 1996. The software is raw and rough around the edges, and often doesn’t work very well, though that can get fixed. But more importantly, no-one quite knows what they should be building. A conference, or an ‘event’, is a bundle. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/4/solving-online-events" target="_blank">https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/4/solving-online-events</a></li><li>it gives a selection filter for people who care. </ul><hr />

<h2>How to Write Usefully, 2020</h2><aside>2020-05-16 23:26:46: What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful. To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough merely to be correct. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://paulgraham.com/useful.html" target="_blank">https://paulgraham.com/useful.html</a></li><li>Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength.

<h2>The Quiet Revolution of Animal Crossing, Ian Bogost, 2020</h2><aside>2020-05-01 11:39:53: In the midst of a pandemic, it’s delightful to imagine doing whatever you like without worrying about making a living.

Want to do no job whatsoever, but just sit on stumps and shake a tambourine? That’s fine too; there are no consequences for not earning “bells.” Nobody cares in Animal Crossing. You are okay.,<li>But according to the Tom Nook doctrine, pastoralism and capitalism coexist perfectly. You can fish for high-value red snappers and sell them to buy espadrilles for your character, or 1950s-diner furnishings for your house. Or you can fish for never-before-seen specimens, to donate them to the museum. Or you can cast a line just to enjoy watching the moon dance across the water. All of these activities are interchangeable and equally delightful. Animal Crossing sees no greater or lesser virtue in one than another.</ul><hr />
