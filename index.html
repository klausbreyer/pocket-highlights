<h2>The Quiet Revolution of Animal Crossing, Ian Bogost, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#0" id="0">&#x23;0</a>, 2020-05-01 11:39:53: Updated at 10:30 a.m. ET on April 15, 2020. Many years ago, when my son was 5, he got upside down on a long-term loan in Animal Crossing, Nintendo’s 2002 video game about running away from home to lead a prosaic life in an adorable animal village. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/animal-crossing-isnt-escapist-its-political/610012/" target="_blank">https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/animal-crossing-isnt-escapist-its-political/610012/</a></li><li>And yet, isn’t this exactly the trade-off that real smartphones demand, a constant lifeline to new options, all more or less the same in nature, judged valuable by how many likes or hearts they accrue?,<li>Every effort is valid, every accomplishment exchangeable for capital. Want to do no job whatsoever, but just sit on stumps and shake a tambourine? That’s fine too; there are no consequences for not earning “bells.” Nobody cares in Animal Crossing. You are okay.,<li>But according to the Tom Nook doctrine, pastoralism and capitalism coexist perfectly. You can fish for high-value red snappers and sell them to buy espadrilles for your character, or 1950s-diner furnishings for your house. Or you can fish for never-before-seen specimens, to donate them to the museum. Or you can cast a line just to enjoy watching the moon dance across the water. All of these activities are interchangeable and equally delightful. Animal Crossing sees no greater or lesser virtue in one than another.</ul><hr />

    <aside><a href="#2" id="2">&#x23;2</a>, 2020-05-16 23:26:46: What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful. To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough merely to be correct. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/useful.html" target="_blank">http://paulgraham.com/useful.html</a></li><li>Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but nonetheless true.</ul><hr />

<h2>Solving online events, Benedict Evans, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#4" id="4">&#x23;4</a>, 2020-06-06 02:16:55: Online events remind me a lot of ecommerce in about 1996. The software is raw and rough around the edges, and often doesn’t work very well, though that can get fixed. But more importantly, no-one quite knows what they should be building. A conference, or an ‘event’, is a bundle. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/4/solving-online-events" target="_blank">https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/4/solving-online-events</a></li><li>it gives a selection filter for people who care. </ul><hr />
<h2>Looking Back on Four Years at The Times, Nick Rockwell, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#5" id="5">&#x23;5</a>, 2020-06-21 01:30:36: A month ago, after four years and a quarter as CTO, I left The New York Times. It was an amazing four years, and I want to take a moment to capture some of what we accomplished, and some of what I learned in the process. First, I will dearly miss the Times. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/looking-back-on-four-years-at-the-times-e158ec3a5936" target="_blank">https://medium.com/swlh/looking-back-on-four-years-at-the-times-e158ec3a5936</a></li><li>Sacrificing alignment in the service of self-defined functional glory is never the answer — fighting through the often painful process of alignment almost always is.,<li>My answer is that a tech org should be evaluated according to the business metrics by which the company itself is assessed. There are two reasons why.,<li>Second, alignment is gold, and non-alignment is poison. A Tech team performing masterfully against misaligned goals is, just, a terrible situation.</ul><hr />
<h2>Antifragility, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#6" id="6">&#x23;6</a>, 2020-07-28 11:43:11: Upon request, I feel like I ought to explain some of these misunderstandings. I already wrote one a few months back on misunderstanding “skin in the game” (it’s not an incentive; it’s a filter). This week we’ll tackle another one: antifragility. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/03/12/antifragility/" target="_blank">https://alexdanco.com/2020/03/12/antifragility/</a></li><li>In a fragile system, that stressor creates uncertainty. You had a plan, and you were good to follow that plan so long as you stayed within a certain state. But now you’re thrown into a new state, so your plan no longer works. You’re in trouble. That’s fragility.
In a robust system, that stressor is information-neutral. You had a plan, and there’s enough buffer or slack in your system to absorb the stressor. Your state is resilient to the new challenge; the plan continues.
In an antifragile system, that stressor resolves uncertainty. You had no preexisting plan; the stressor tells you what to do. In an antifragile system, stressors are information. Without stressors, an antifragile system is rudderless. It doesn’t know how to grow or what to do. It actively suffers, until a challenge gives it direction.,<li>Accordingly, antifragile systems and organisms tend towards a common theme: bottoms-up decision-making, rather than top-down decision making. Antifragility requires real options, and real options are low-cost. Antifragility is only successful if you can actually detect, react, and grow in response to deviations from your present state in real time; the only way you can feasibly do this is for disorder detection and response to take place at a small enough resolution, and tight enough turnaround time. Top-down systems have a hard time with antifragility, because for them, all options are costly. ,<li>Antifragility is something you do, rather than something you have or something you are. Antifragility is an operating state of growing through continuous reaction. It’s like the opposite of predicting the future. You’re not making any forward-looking assumptions about anything, but you need disorder: you need a state change to have something to react to. Good antifragile systems react quickly and correctly, like the Hydra growing new heads when you cut one off. Without disorder, the Hydra doesn’t grow.

<h2>Remote work is a platform, Jason Fried, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#7" id="7">&#x23;7</a>, 2020-07-28 12:07:08: Back in the mid-90s, just as Netscape Navigator was giving us our first look at what the visual internet could be, web design came in two flavors. There was the ultra basic stuff. Text on a page, maybe a masthead graphic of some sort. Nothing sophisticated. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/remote-work-is-a-platform/" target="_blank">https://m.signalvnoise.com/remote-work-is-a-platform/</a></li><li>No one knew what to make of the web at that time, so we pulled over things we were familiar with and sunk them in place. At that time, Web design wasn’t web design – it was print design, multimedia/interactive design, and graphic design. It took years for native web design to come into its own.,<li>They’ll have stopped trying to make remote look like local. They’ll have discovered that remote work means more autonomy, more trust, more uninterrupted stretches of time, smaller teams, more independent, concurrent work (and less dependent, sequenced work)</ul><hr />

None of your customers will ask you to turn your attention to expanding. They want you to keep your attention focused on them.

Instead of trying to grow your business in volume or quantity grow it qualitatively.
Your current clients are going to be your best source of newer clients anyway.

<h2>Attention is your scarcest resource, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#9" id="9">&#x23;9</a>, 2020-08-04 00:10:27: Like many people, I have most of my best ideas in the shower. This is sometimes annoying: I could use more than one shower’s worth of good ideas a day, but I’d rather not end up as a shrivelled yet insightful prune. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/attention/" target="_blank">https://www.benkuhn.net/attention/</a></li><li>Monotask
As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I’d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.
In the short term, this made me less efficient, because I’d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for long enough, I’d eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner’s API in a fit of rage. This resulted in me shipping my most important projects faster, hence getting faster compounding growth.</ul><hr />
<h2>Misunderstanding "Skin in the Game", Alex Danco, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#10" id="10">&#x23;10</a>, 2020-08-06 08:41:01: As the dog days of summer stretch on, I’ve been doing a lot of trail running to keep active. The east end of Toronto is home to a spectacular and unsanctioned, semi-secret network of mountain biking trails that line the river valley ravines. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://danco.substack.com/p/misunderstanding-skin-in-the-game" target="_blank">https://danco.substack.com/p/misunderstanding-skin-in-the-game</a></li><li>Upside incentive can matter a great deal, but it has almost nothing to do with skin in the game the way that Taleb uses the phrase. When Taleb talks about “Skin in the game”, he’s talking about survival. A small business owner does not have SitG because she’s incentivized to run her business well; she has SitG because if she doesn’t run her business well, then it doesn’t stick around. ,<li>just raise less money! It’ll force you to work harder, learner, and smarter, and it’ll force you to get things right faster, or run out of cash trying. But I’ll bet you that’s not what these people have in mind.,<li>The core, unifying theme across all of Taleb's writing - from his early work around randomness and The Black Swan through later works like Antifragility and Skin in the Game - is the logic of risk-taking. Taleb takes great offence at creating work, exercise, or any other kind of activity that’s designed to consciously offload risk from the participant; he’s particularly fond of complaining about elliptical machines at the gym, jogging, or really any kind of exercise that isn’t free weight deadlifting. But I have a distinct feeling that he would be willing to make an exception for trail running, which seems like it’d be a lot more in his ballpark.</ul><hr />

    <aside><a href="#11" id="11">&#x23;11</a>, 2020-08-11 03:10:56: When building a product from scratch you need to do a lot of hard things all at once, with limited resources. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://davnicwil.com/if-its-a-nice-problem-to-have-dont-solve-it-now" target="_blank">https://davnicwil.com/if-its-a-nice-problem-to-have-dont-solve-it-now</a></li><li>An example to illustrate is signup functionality.

And so the short answer is always the same — how do we optimize for the success of the firm? For the projects the firm is involved in, how do I optimize my contribution to that? So, you know, it’s been the same answer to the question every year for 11 years in a row and I don’t think it’ll change anytime soon. I think it’s more of trying to tune against a single goal as compared to trying to rethink the goals.</ul><hr />
<h2>On Being Bipolar, Andrea Bennett, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#14" id="14">&#x23;14</a>, 2020-10-05 09:48:43: Sometime in my mid-to-late twenties, less than a decade after I’d been diagnosed bipolar II, I participated in a study that sought to glean insights from “high-functioning” bipolar people—presumably to figure out why we were high functioning and if anything we had to share could help others </aside><ul><li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/on-being-bipolar/" target="_blank">https://thewalrus.ca/on-being-bipolar/</a></li><li>I don’t dream about not being bipolar, because I don’t know where my self ends and where the illness begins—and if there is even really a difference.

<h2>Systems thinking for startups, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#15" id="15">&#x23;15</a>, 2020-10-05 09:57:29: Peter Senge has been called the most influential business strategists of the century and in my view Senge is the successor of Peter Drucker, the management visionary. Senge published a book in 1990 called The Fifth Discipline which I think every manager, founder and CEO should read. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.tomtunguz.com/learning-organizations/" target="_blank">https://www.tomtunguz.com/learning-organizations/</a></li><li>The systems viewpoint is generally oriented toward the long-term view.

They only come back to haunt you in the long term.


				
				
				
				
			
		
		
		
	,<li>Thus, we may cut our advertising budgets, see the benefits in terms of cost savings, and in turn further trim spending in this area. In the short run there may be little impact on people’s demands for our goods and services, but longer term the decline in visibility may have severe penalties. An appreciation of systems will lead to recognition of the use of, and problems with, such reinforcing feedback, and also an understanding of the place of balancing (or stabilizing) feedback.

<h2>Early Work, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#17" id="17">&#x23;17</a>, 2020-10-25 11:07:55: One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on where they don't seem very impressive, even to their creators. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/early.html" target="_blank">http://paulgraham.com/early.html</a></li><li>The right way to deal with new ideas is to treat them as a challenge to your imagination not just to have lower standards, but to switch polarity entirely, from listing the reasons an idea won't work to trying to think of ways it could.,<li>Making new things is itself a new thing for us as a species. It has always happened, but till the last few centuries it happened so slowly as to be invisible to individual humans. And since we didn't need customs for dealing with new ideas, we didn't develop any.
We just don't have enough experience with early versions of ambitious projects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we would judge more finished work, or less ambitious projects. We don't realize they're a special case.</ul><hr />
<h2>Why Life Can’t Be Simpler, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#18" id="18">&#x23;18</a>, 2020-12-10 23:36:31: We’d all like life to be simpler. But we also don’t want to sacrifice our options and capabilities. Tesler’s law of the conservation of complexity, a rule from design, explains why we can’t have both. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://fs.blog/2020/10/why-life-cant-be-simpler/" target="_blank">https://fs.blog/2020/10/why-life-cant-be-simpler/</a></li><li>As long as you pay your bills, the water supply to your house is probably fully automated. When you turn on a tap, you don’t need to have requested there to be water in the pipes first. The companies that manage the water supply handle the complexity.,<li>Complexity is like energy. It cannot be created or destroyed, only moved somewhere else. When a product or service becomes simpler for users, engineers and designers have to work harder. Norman writes, “With technology, simplifications at the level of usage invariably result in added complexity of the underlying mechanism. ” For example, the files and folders conceptual model for computer interfaces doesn’t change how files are stored, but by putting in extra work to translate the process into something recognizable, designers make navigating them easier for users.</ul><hr />
<h2>Container orchestration tools explained, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#19" id="19">&#x23;19</a>, 2020-12-13 07:35:38: The way we write, ship, and maintain software today has evolved drastically in the last few years. How we consume underlying infrastructure to run our software has matured significantly, in that we have seen a transition from bare metal to virtual machines to containers to micro-VMs. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://dev.to/sarmadsaleem/container-orchestration-tools-explained-1c4i" target="_blank">https://dev.to/sarmadsaleem/container-orchestration-tools-explained-1c4i</a></li><li>An important distinction between virtual machines and containers is that VM virtualizes underlying hardware whereas the container virtualizes the underlying operating system.

<h2>How to Think for Yourself, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#20" id="20">&#x23;20</a>, 2020-12-13 23:43:36: There are some kinds of work that you can't do well without thinking differently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for example, it's not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be both correct and novel. You can't publish papers saying things other people already know. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html" target="_blank">http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html</a></li><li>The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert: fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to fill it.
Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one another in much the same way muscles can. If you're sufficiently fastidious about truth, you don't need to be as resistant to being told what to think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps in your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity, because if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiosity can compensate for them: if you're sufficiently curious, you don't need to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discover will push out the conventional ones you acquired by default.,<li>One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs are. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and make more effort to find out.,<li>You don't want to start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea, or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but that you know isn't like writing software for a tiny computer used by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people rent airbeds on strangers' floors.
Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already knew would be boring. You have to tell them something new.</ul><hr />

<h2>How to be indistractable, Nir Eyal, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#23" id="23">&#x23;23</a>, 2020-12-22 08:30:05: Identifying the triggers that made you feel bad in the first place requires self-exploration. When you notice yourself feeling distracted, pause and ask yourself what you’re feeling. Are you worried? Are you afraid? Then go one step deeper. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://psyche.co/guides/to-become-indistractable-recognise-that-it-starts-within-you" target="_blank">https://psyche.co/guides/to-become-indistractable-recognise-that-it-starts-within-you</a></li><li>. I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, I’d become the disciplined writer and focused father I’d always strived to be.
Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. ‘Hmmm,’ I said to myself, ‘I really should take a glance at this book’. I’d justify the distraction as necessary for ‘research’. And if it wasn’t reading, then I’d find something else – the laundry that needed to be folded right now, my desk that needed to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasn’t distracting me. I was distracting me.,<li>Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something,<li>I discovered that I was just as susceptible to being distracted by a news report or a dirty closet as I was by a glowing screen. Does that mean I cut out the news, or let my closets go? No. It meant having to figure out what I was avoiding (writing) and why I was avoiding it (all the writerly anxieties) and then dealing with those. It also meant building systems to manage my time, attention and internet use.</ul><hr />

<h2>Validation is a mirage, Jason Fried, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#25" id="25">&#x23;25</a>, 2020-12-27 03:10:09: Spend enough time talking with entrepreneurs, product people, designers, and anyone charged with proving something, and you’ll bump into questions about validation. You can’t. You can’t. You can’t. You can’t. You can’t. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/validation-is-a-mirage/" target="_blank">https://m.signalvnoise.com/validation-is-a-mirage/</a></li><li>If you want to see if something works, make it. The whole thing. The simplest version of the whole thing – that’s what version 1.0 is supposed to be. But make that, put it out there, and learn. If you want answers, you have to ask the question, and the question is: Market, what do you think of this completed version 1.0 of our product?
,<li>When I hear MVP, I don’t think Minimum Viable Product. I think Minimum Viable Pie. The food kind.
A slice of pie is all you need to evaluate the whole pie. It’s homogenous. But that’s not how products work. Products are a collection of interwoven parts, one dependent on another, one leading to another, one integrating with another. You can’t take a slice a product, ask people how they like it, and deduce they’ll like the rest of the product once you’ve completed it. All you learn is that they like or don’t like the slice you gave them.,<li>Truth is, you don’t know, you won’t know, you’ll never know until you know and reflect back on something real. And the best way to find out, is to believe in it, make it, and put it out there. You do your best, you promote it the best you can, you prepare yourself the best way you know how. And then you literally cross your fingers. I’m not kidding.
You can’t validate something that doesn’t exist. You can’t validate an idea. You can’t validate someone’s guess. You can’t validate an abstraction. You can’t validate a sketch, or a wireframe, or an MVP that isn’t the actual product.</ul><hr />

<h2>My favorite essays of life advice, 2020</h2>
    <aside><a href="#27" id="27">&#x23;27</a>, 2020-12-31 01:49:43: I start each of my weekly reviews by re-reading one of my favorite essays of life advice—a different one each week.

Most people want to believe what they learn is the truth: there are a few people who doubt everything. If you believe too much then you are not likely to find the essentially new view that transforms a field, and if you doubt too much you will not be able to do much at all. It is a fine balance between believing what you learn and at the same time doubting things. Great steps forward usually involve a change of viewpoint to outside the standard ones in the field.</ul><hr />
<h2>What Shape are You?, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#28" id="28">&#x23;28</a>, 2021-01-01 13:47:07: My post before this was a kind of therapy / Buddhism / personal growth kind of deal, but I also spend a lot of time thinking about how to run effective teams and to be a responsible, thoughtful manager of people. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://madeofmetaphors.com/shapes" target="_blank">https://madeofmetaphors.com/shapes</a></li><li>But at higher levels, there's just too much to spell it all out. It's important to try, to define boundaries for that shape so you have some way to talk about them, but you can't capture all of it in full detail. It relies on a mutual understanding about implied work.
Some work yields knowledge that you need to do other work, and so a viable role that does one of these things must do the other.,<li>If you're in charge of writing some code, you also have to comment it, because if you don't, nobody else will understand it well enough to do it for you. If you're in charge of coming up with a creative direction for a project, you also need to communicate it outwards to others, because if you don't, nobody else knows enough to do it for you.
,<li>As you get more senior, maybe you're a specialist, so your shape gets bigger and the boundary remains nice and clear. Or you end up as a lead, and you're able to fill spaces in the project and pick up slack that few others can, so your boundary gets messier,<li>These diagrams I'm drawing fundamentally express project development as a subtractive process: you start with a mountain of stuff to get done, and by the time you're done, someone will have done all of it. These diagrams visualize the abstract notion that there's "all the work" and each person subtracts some of it from the space, and you're done when everything has been subtracted.
But not all work is subtractive. Consider a factory worker assembling cars. If he assembles 2 cars in a day, he makes the company a profit; if he works harder and assembles 4 cars in a day, he makes the company twice as much. This is an additive sort of work. You can do the same work, but just more of it, and you generate more value.
Creative endeavors are not additive. They are iterative, convergent processes, and so they are subtractive: you work until you have converged, and then you stop.,<li>During conversations about performance, everything you talk about should boil down to one thing: the value they contribute to the team. What is their value, and how can they become more valuable?,<li>And to managers, I'd say: when you talk to your reports, help them think about their work and everyone's work as subtractive, as cutting out shapes from the big space of all work. Tell them what things are clearly theirs, and talk about those with whom they share boundaries, and what those boundaries should be. Talk about imperatives: tell them what kinds of problems you foresee and what roles you see them playing in the solutions. Talk about the whole project, even the stuff they'd never otherwise hear about - especially that stuff. Give them context. Talk about convergence. Help them see their shapes.</ul><hr />

<h2>Difficult Conversations, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#31" id="31">&#x23;31</a>, 2021-01-03 09:42:15: I had a post written about difficult conversations. It was quite reasonable. Then I read this article by Clayton Christensen on the Harvard Business Review, and specifically this quote: "Management is the most noble of professions if it’s practiced well. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://madeofmetaphors.com/difficult-conversations" target="_blank">http://madeofmetaphors.com/difficult-conversations</a></li><li>How do you know when you should have a difficult conversation? Obviously you shouldn't berate people constantly just because you believe they could be doing a tiny bit better. Let's say you have someone who's doing fine, could probably be doing more, but when you probe a bit, seems totally content. Just mention to him the options - "If you ever want to do more, we can talk about that" - and leave it at that. He doesn't have a problem. Don't project your impatience onto people. But if you have someone who's not succeeding and wants to be, or who clearly wants to do more and is being held back by limitations he doesn't understand or believe, that's a dissonance. Dissonance is a signal that you need to have a difficult conversation,<li>If you're afraid of difficult conversations, only having difficult conversations will make you less afraid. And second, it gets better. Have those difficult conversations and the fear will recede. I promise.,<li>The key part of a difficult conversation is being in touch with the proper intention when you go into it. In a nutshell, that intention is this: I am telling you these observations I have made even though it is difficult for me because I care about you and believe they may help you learn and grow.
Here are a few notable things that aren't part of that intention: I expect you to take this advice. My observations are absolutely correct. I am personally attached to the outcome. I know better than you do what's appropriate for you. I'm telling you this because I want you to see me as smart. I'm telling you this because I like identifying as a "mentor" or "teacher" or "wise person."</ul><hr />
<h2>How to Stop Endless Discussions, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#32" id="32">&#x23;32</a>, 2021-01-03 15:24:55: I often see people believe in their solution and think theirs are better than the others'. They defend their cases without having an exact reason. These situations often create long and meaningless discussions that go nowhere. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://candost.blog/how-to-stop-endless-discussions/" target="_blank">https://candost.blog/how-to-stop-endless-discussions/</a></li><li>We used the NABC model from Stanford. The model starts with defining the Need, followed by Approach, Benefits, and lastly, Competitors. Separating the Need from the approach is very smart. While writing the need, the authors have to understand it very well. The approach and benefits sections are pretty straightforward, where authors define their strategy and list down the advantages.,<li>The RFC process uses a document written by someone about their proposal on a topic. It has a specific timeframe and everyone can give feedback on it. The RFC and feedbacks are posted publicly. Everyone can join the discussion. The goal is to include as many people as possible to access more points of view and spread the knowledge simultaneously. The good thing is that people focus on the proposed idea and give their feedback based on facts instead of only beliefs. On the other hand, it has a way bigger effect.,<li>These hidden gems of writing the idea in a structured way and asking people for comments afterward prevents many endless debates,<li>The process seeks a consent-based environment, not a consensus-based one. If some people care about a topic a lot and come up with a written document that explains many things in detail, everyone can (and should) trust them. The authors shouldn't wait for everyone's confirmation of their proposal. When they get enough feedback, they should be able to continue further with or abandon the idea. It's their decision. Since they prepared the doc and collected many comments on it, they can have a better judgment.,<li>That's why we need to balance both taking action and asking people to present their opinion on a topic. This balance is achievable with an excellent process.  
I helped build this balanced process in an organization where we aimed to solve another problem - the lack of feedback. We introduced a process called Request For Comments (RFC). It is a common feedback mechanism in the software world presented by the Internet Society (ISOC) and used currently in the Rust language</ul><hr />
<h2>Boundaries and Infinities: A Post about Responsibility, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#33" id="33">&#x23;33</a>, 2021-01-04 12:46:20: This post is a sequel to my Role Shapes post from last year. Like that post, this post is about a metaphor for working on a team, and talks about each of us as shapes in a space of work that gets done. This year, I’m talking about a slightly different space. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://madeofmetaphors.com/boundaries-and-infinities" target="_blank">http://madeofmetaphors.com/boundaries-and-infinities</a></li><li>Her shape on that diagram, then, represents all those responsibilities. Emily’s shape is finite: it is bounded on all sides. It doesn't shoot off into infinity. And all the adjacent shapes are other people’s roles. ,<li>The challenges Paul faces are the challenges of a man faced with infinite potential and limited time. And to succeed, he’ll need vision, personal talent, discipline, confidence, and decisiveness.,<li>Paul has a team, now, and they look to him for management and counsel. They’re mostly finite shapes, so they need a manager who can tell them about political savvy and nuance and help them develop the skills of working within their constrained roles but still having an impact.
But Paul doesn't know how to do any of that. He knows how to forge ahead and make big decisions and push on things so they get done. And none of those are appropriate behaviors for his new team members.,<li>The way you avoid waste in small organizations is by staying lean and not wasting time with politics. In larger organizations, it’s almost the opposite: you avoid waste by respecting the boundary lines between shapes and navigating them with nuanced coordination, communication, and management, none of which are usually strengths for people like Paul, who got to where he did precisely because he thrives when there aren't boundary lines.,<li>To succeed, the skills she’ll need include discipline and personal talent for the production work, of course, but moreover she’ll need the political savvy and social skills to navigate the boundaries between her shape and others’ with nuance,<li>Those boundaries are dark black lines in the diagrams, but in reality they’re much fuzzier – they have to be fluid. And when you are in a role like Emily’s, the fluidity at the boundary is the most interesting part. That example is a simple one, too. They get far more complicated:,<li>People like Paul, when they give advice, often focus on personal effectiveness, alpha behavior, and triage, and deride or overlook the importance of management, coordination, and “overhead.” They are allergic to process and overhead because for small companies, that’s the right way to be. It takes tremendous self-awareness, humility, and flexibility for people in Paul’s situation to internalize the changes intrinsic to a growing company and develop that new skill set,<li>People in privileged positions who don’t understand the importance of relationship-building and nuance in larger organizations end up marauding through situations and leaving them even worse off, all the while thinking they’re being highly effective.,<li>Because his tenure makes him the 800lb gorilla, but people in Paul’s situation can be surprisingly oblivious to this. Often, Paul doesn't understand why other people don’t just behave like he does. After all, it works for him!,<li> 
Paul’s shape is infinite – if you keep zooming out, it keeps going. There are no boundaries at the edges. Paul’s responsibilities look like this:
Decide what needs to be done.
Do all of it.,<li>In terms of the visual metaphor, the difference between them is that Emily’s shape is finite and Paul’s is infinite. A finite shape has a finite list of responsibilities, and the nuance is in the fractal intricacy of its boundary with all the other shapes. An infinite shape’s responsibilities end with “et cetera”, and the nuance is in triage: The shape is infinite, but the person occupying it is finite.
The interesting part is when conditions change.</ul><hr />

<h2>How to remember what you learn, Vasili Shynkarenka, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#37" id="37">&#x23;37</a>, 2021-01-11 23:23:39: The book I held in my hands was full of highlights. It seemed like I’ve got all colors of the rainbow on a page. Apparently, this didn’t help. When I tried recalling ideas from the book, I didn’t hear a thing. Just. Silence. Terrified, I started questioning how much I really know. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/" target="_blank">https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/</a></li><li>After I’m done with the summary, I write down the answers to three questions:
What are the key ideas?
How can I apply this knowledge that I learned?
How do these ideas relate to what I already know?,<li>Make it time-based, take regular breaks, and learn what you’re curious about.
,<li>But the purpose of this “picture walk” reading is different; it’s to catch my curiosity. And curiosity is different from understanding because it’s either happens or not. It’s like you’re seeing a pretty girl; you don’t really sit and reason, “well, do I really like her?”,<li>By taking just 10 minutes a day to quickly scroll through the book instead of my Twitter feed, I end up having 365 books scrolled in a year. From these 365, about two end up being life-changing, ten – deeply interesting, and ten – sort of interesting. Everything else is noise. 94%.
Now, do the math. If I didn’t have this discovery routine and aimed to read books from cover to cover, I’d randomly sample about twenty books from 365 with meager chances of all of them being good. And I was doing that for years. So don’t repeat my mistake and invest 5-10 minutes a day to discover what you learn from, because learning is like eating. You become what you consume.,<li>. I usually start from the book description to understand what it’s about, and write down a couple sentences, trying to guess what’s coming up. Then I go straight to the table of contents and see if anything catches my attention there,<li>The second file is where I write about what I’m learning. Folks in the kitchen call it metacognition, which means thinking about thinking. Metacognition is the single best trick I’ve found to improve understanding, and I will write more about it in the future. Whenever I don’t understand something or see that my understanding is shallow, I begin writing in the first person. It looks like this: “So Peter explains that there are four characteristics of a monopoly, but I don’t really understand why branding is one of them; why so?”,<li>Having a file with my thinking about the subject keeps my working memory clean. I don’t feel overloaded as I usually feel after reading many articles at one go. You’ve probably experienced this yourself; your brain is almost melting after an hour of scrolling through the web. That’s because you present yourself with too much information without really making sense of it. After a few months of applying metacognitive practices, I realized that I can’t go back. It just feels so strange to experience that cognitive load again.,<li>So much of what we call creativity and intelligence is just memory. If you think you can look it up on Google, you’re wrong. The thought process is way faster than looking stuff up, and when you’re thinking about something or solving an important problem, you have to have your toolkit ready. Also, the most interesting ideas come when you’re not at your desk but showering, glazing over stars or wandering around in the city center. When you can’t Google. And this tiny 10-minute habit of recalling ideas is totally worth it if you think of the implications on a fifty-year timeframe.,<li> file with questions,<li>A file with a timestamp where my random thoughts go.

      long enough for a developer to get distracted, decide to open an email or go
      and get a coffee, so that now they are distracted and out of their state of
      flow, there is research that indicates  it can
      take up to 23 minutes to get back into the state of flow and return to high
      productivity. I am not suggesting that engineers should not take breaks and
      clear their head occasionally! But they should do that intentionally, not

Some of these pieces of infrastructure change very slowly (like roads), while others are much more flexible, like the way apartments or shops are used. What if software were built in the same way? What if the core parts of our business would be like streets, and all that newfangled stuff is something we could build on top, experiment, tear it down if it does not work? I’ve seen a few e-commerce companies from the inside, and while their systems are marvel of technologies able to handle thousands of transactions per second, it does not feel like this, but things like the app and the website are very deeply entangled with the rest.

The value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth rate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion dollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when it reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower. That's why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The low initial cost of starting a startup means founders can start young, and the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeed they could be surprisingly rich just a few years later.</ul><hr />

    <aside><a href="#57" id="57">&#x23;57</a>, 2021-06-13 01:48:41: To start with, let’s take a moment. Draw a breath. Slow yourself down. What’s going on? What are you thinking and feeling? What most deserves your attention? There’s a great line in Robert Poynton’s book Do Pause (2019) that speaks to the significance of taking stock in this way: </aside><ul><li><a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication" target="_blank">https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication</a></li><li>Inviting people to pause is among the easiest advice in the world to give, and the hardest to take. Yet it’s foundational to clarifying your thinking, because this is where it all begins: with a moment of self-reflection. Without pauses, there can be no second thoughts and no self-interrogations. There is no process until you take the time to embark upon it. You might think that this point is too obvious to be worth making. Yet, in my experience, it’s where most of us fall down. We all carry around countless unclear, confused, contradictory thoughts and feelings. And precisely because we have neither the time nor the tools to sort them out, they mostly stay this way. Once you’ve paused, a common psychotherapeutic exercise can help you take a first step towards clearer thinking. It’s about observing yourself as neutrally as possible. You make yourself comfortable, relax, then try to notice the flow of your thoughts and feelings in a nonjudgmental way: the flickers of anxiety, anticipation, regret; the memories and ideas bubbling into consciousness.,<li>This suggests that either: I don’t believe the above reasons to be true, or to be the whole story; or that I do, yet somehow still don’t find them compelling.</ul><hr />

In addition to your typical engineering duties, you are a part of the product manager/tech lead/product designer trifecta and you collaborate on product decisions.1 </aside><ul><li><a href="https://domk.website/blog/2021-01-12-tech-lead-empowered-product-team.html" target="_blank">https://domk.website/blog/2021-01-12-tech-lead-empowered-product-team.html</a></li><li> If everyone “does their bit” in isolation in order to combine them at the end, it isn’t true collaboration. True collaboration requires a high bandwidth conversation where you can bounce ideas off of each other and work in small increments,<li>that the role is different both from purely technical senior IC roles and from engineering management roles. While all of the above traits can be learned, not every senior IC or manager is a good fit for a tech lead.,<li>Assessing feasibility is the main expertise you bring to the product team leadership trifecta. You are in a unique position to know what is and isn’t possible with the technology you have or can have.</ul><hr />
<h2>Don’t Feed the Thought Leaders, Adam Gordon Bell, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#62" id="62">&#x23;62</a>, 2021-07-29 13:41:21: Here is a somewhat fictionalized personal story. I’ve changed the names of the people and the technology used. I was a new engineering manager whose team was starting a new small but ambitious project at a SAAS company. The company had several hundred developers, and the project was approved. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/thought-leaders/" target="_blank">https://earthly.dev/blog/thought-leaders/</a></li><li>Tetlock’s talk on this is subtitled “Ignore Confident Forecasters,” which I think is an excellent summary of his findings.,<li>Still, there is some evidence that noncontingent, one-big-idea advice is less valuable than more nuanced, complicated advice.,<li>Thankfully, not all the advice I received was bad. One person, in particular, asked very pointed questions about the problems be solved and identified some potential blind spots in our plan. They also offered a great tip for dealing with advice that didn’t seem relevant to the project’s success: Create an extended product roadmap and put those items at least a year off into the future “and as long as they don’t seem relevant, you can just keep pushing them into the future.” Perversely this plan made everyone happy – everyone’s feedback is on the roadmap, and now it’s all just a question of priorities. </ul><hr />

<h2>How to Work Hard, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#65" id="65">&#x23;65</a>, 2021-07-29 18:46:57: It might not seem there's much to learn about how to work hard. Anyone who's been to school knows what it entails, even if they chose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. </aside><ul><li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html" target="_blank">http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html</a></li><li>Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It's a complicated, dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind you're best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you can, accurately judge at each moment both what you're capable of and how you're doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can without harming the quality of the result. This network is too complicated to trick. But if you're consistently honest and clear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and you'll be productive in a way few people are.      ,<li>The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously from one person to another. That's one of the most important things I've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is figure out what it is. That's how it works in movies, and in the streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly from one kind of work to another.,<li>The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate a sensitivity to the quality of the work you're doing, and then you'll notice if it decreases because you're working too hard. Honesty is critical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you're being lazy, but also when you're working too hard. And if you think there's something admirable about working too hard, get that idea out of your head. </ul><hr />

The guy doing the "easy" tasks gets no help, so it's harder to succeed. ,<li>One thing you want to prevent is people learning to remind you earlier. The way to accomplish it is being very nice when they come late. If people feel punished for reminding too late, they'll come earlier next time, and in a vengeful mood, so with more needless tasks. But if they're late and you eagerly "try to do the best under the circumstances", not only do you put yourself under the spotlight as a patriotic hero, you move the forgetful culprit out of the spotlight. So they'll form a rosy memory of the incident, and not learn the value of coming earlier – precisely what we want.,<li>Urgent things automatically become harder, a person in a hurry more important. The later it's done, the easier it is to get help (while retaining the status of "the" hero in the center of it all who made it happen.) Under time pressure, the scope shrinks, making the formerly "easy" and now officially "hard" thing genuinely easier. This is particularly useful for the really disgusting, but unavoidable work</ul><hr />

This type of mental trick is addictive, and it alters your perception of normal, developing a need to work that is disconnected from your personal goals.

<h2>Farnam Street, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#71" id="71">&#x23;71</a>, 2021-07-31 11:05:30: In April of 1958, Hunter S. Thompson was 22 years old when he wrote this letter to his friend Hume Logan in response to a request for life advice. Thompson’s letter, found in Letters of Note, offers some of the most thoughtful and profound advice I’ve ever come across. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://fs.blog/2014/05/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/" target="_blank">https://fs.blog/2014/05/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/</a></li><li>The answer— and, in a sense, the tragedy of life— is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It’s not the fireman who has changed, but you. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.,<li>beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life. But you say, “I don’t know where to look; I don’t know what to look for.” ,<li>As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES.</ul><hr />

Two hours after the show ended, he was gone. For two days, I’ve been working on a piece to pay tribute to him, and it’s been a struggle. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://thefirsttenwords.wordpress.com/2018/05/31/its-not-what-you-think/" target="_blank">https://thefirsttenwords.wordpress.com/2018/05/31/its-not-what-you-think/</a></li><li>You might think grunge is about anger, but that’s not completely true. Yes, it can sound that way, but it’s really about depression and cynicism. Those two go hand-in-hand, along with their nasty little sister, anxiety. When the three of them get going, they just eat hope as quickly as it can be summoned. That leaves despair and despair is exhausting, not just for those who experience it, but for the people around it as well. So we keep it to ourselves because we don’t want to be a burden. And then it gets to be too much.,<li>It’s possible that, along with grunge, Generation X’s other great gift to society is depression. I mean, of course it was here long before the Baby Boomers started re-producing, but we talk about it more than those who came before us. We talk about it as a demon or a monster. It’s a dark shadow that shows itself at any point in time without warning. It surrounds us, isolates us, and quiets us. Depression likes to blame things. We feel like shit because of mistakes we have made in life or because of the state of the world or because we aren’t perfect. Without a lot of help and a lot of work, it’s impossible to know that it really is a chemical imbalance in our brains. After twenty-plus years of trying to de-stigmatize depression, some of us still have a hard time recognizing it for what it is. And even then, it doesn’t always matter.</ul><hr />

It’s a contract between hard-pushing managers and developers needing time to think and explore.,<li>It turns out that prioritizing individuals and interactions is a hard concept to sell. It’s much easier to sell processes and tools. It turns out that working software is harder to produce than unrealistic plans and reams of documentation. It turns out that collaborating with customers requires trust and vulnerability, not always present in a business setting. It turns out that responding to change often gets outweighed by executives wanting to feel in control and still legitimately needing to make long-term plans for their businesses.,<li>They weren’t project managers or CTOs or VP Engs.

Is test coverage a useful metric? What does it mean to “shift testing left”? When and where should we be testing? How much is enough testing? </aside><ul><li><a href="https://dannorth.net/2021/07/26/we-need-to-talk-about-testing/" target="_blank">https://dannorth.net/2021/07/26/we-need-to-talk-about-testing/</a></li><li>To summarise: TDD, BDD, ATDD, and related methods categorically do not replace testing, whatever their names may suggest. They are primarily design and development techniques.,<li>The purpose of testing is to increase confidence for stakeholders through evidence.  ,<li>Shifting left on testing means thinking about architecture and design differently, considering different stakeholders early and continually. Which in turn means shifting left on security, accessibility, and all the other dimensions of quality that we should care about. So shifting left on testing motivates all kinds of assurance activities, which can stop us over-investing in a solution that was never going to work. It is like TDD on steroids.</ul><hr />

<h2>The Mindset That Kills Product Thinking, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#77" id="77">&#x23;77</a>, 2021-08-06 20:52:14: My friend Marty Cagan released two articles, this one and this one, describing some of the challenges to product thinking. You should read them. He’s right. This article is about something more fundamental than that. It’s about the service provider anti-pattern baked into our processes. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.jpattonassociates.com/mindset-that-kills-product-thinking/" target="_blank">https://www.jpattonassociates.com/mindset-that-kills-product-thinking/</a></li><li>There’s one simple thing you and your team can do right now to start breaking the habit:  Reflect on the outcome of everything you release.  ,<li>Reread the agile manifesto and all those values and principles. Notice how they’re written from the service provider’s perspective. Notice how customer, user, and the business are used almost interchangeably. Look at values like: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation That’s exactly what I want when I hire a kitchen remodeler. But collaboration doesn’t make much sense when I choose a product to use. Look at principles like: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software This makes perfect sense if you’re building software for money,<li>Too much work, or extra unplanned work is a good thing for him. It’s called “demand” in product speak. If he has more demand than he can satisfy he can: Hire more people Raise prices to reduce demand Turn down work – which often makes him more desirable enhancing his brand,<li>I start lots of classes and talks by asking “what makes a product great?” Try this yourself right now. Think of a product you use routinely. Ask yourself why it’s great. Really. Pause and do that. I’ve done this long enough to know that a few things always come up. Things like: Easy to use Solves a problem Fun Delightful Saves me time ,<li>Service providers make money selling time and materials. The service they provide is the product.  Interestingly if your stakeholders love your work it likely doesn’t impact your business one way or another. And, I bet your company doesn’t make money selling your time and materials. And happy stakeholders giving you even more work isn’t helpful. It just buries you in more work. ,<li>After releasing a feature, use part of your team’s routine reflection or retrospective to discuss how long the whole feature actually took relative to what you’d planned. Discuss its quality. Those are the service provider outcomes and they do matter. But, remember, they’re table stakes. What matters more is the outcome. </ul><hr />
<h2>The Importance of Written Communication for Engineering Teams, Stephanie Emma Pfeffer, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#78" id="78">&#x23;78</a>, 2021-08-11 03:22:41: While good engineering managers can code, great ones can also communicate. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/engineering-management/written-communication-workplace" target="_blank">https://www.toptal.com/engineering-management/written-communication-workplace</a></li><li>To arrive at this solution, says Buritica, the first step is to survey the team about the issue: “How should we talk to each other? How should we communicate our availability? What isn’t working? What can work better? How should we deal with emergencies?”

“Everyone is given the ability to provide suggestions, and I will come back with a draft of consolidated proposals,” he says. “Then as a team we discuss it, roll it out, and pilot it.”

After he publishes the first draft, the team operates within the suggested framework for a few weeks to evaluate how the new process is working. Over time they integrate other necessary changes into the document until it defines standard operation.,<li>While good engineering managers can code, great ones can also communicate.</ul><hr />

Call it a convention, stop pretending it’s the best, it’s just how we (or you) decided to do things. If it’s pattern, fine, but be ready to tell me why it’s applicable and helpful in our context. And stop calling it best, call it by its name. If you can’t explain why you’re doing something, and you’re just doing what you’ve been seeing others do, maybe rethink it and educate yourself on the topic.

<h2>How Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum, Gergely Orosz, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#96" id="96">&#x23;96</a>, 2021-11-17 23:37:46: Project management is a topic most people have strong opinions on, and I’m no exception. To answer the question of how different companies run engineering projects, I pulled in help from across the industry. In this issue we’ll cover: </aside><ul><li><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/project-management-at-big-tech/" target="_blank">https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/project-management-at-big-tech/</a></li><li>In many cases, Product Managers do not own project management at Big Tech. The team is responsible for the execution, and the team lead – usually the Engineering Manager – is responsible for making this happen.,<li>Teams with dedicated project managers typically recorded lower satisfaction ratings at public or venture-funded tech companies. However, at non-venture funded companies and consultancies, several respondents were very happy with project management, and called out these people as a reason for their satisfaction. Teams being allowed to choose their own way of working was more common at public tech companies and venture-funded scaleups. Large, non-tech companies and smaller, non-venture-funded companies were more likely to mandate the same approach for all teams within the company. Team autonomy and high satisfaction seemed to be correlated. Many people rating their satisfaction as 4 or 5 mentioned autonomy, freedom and flexibility, and the putting of quality first at the team level, as a positive. Teams struggling often had little to do with the methodologies. People mentioned lack of vision, good engineers leaving, lack of transparency or poor tooling as reasons why things went badly. For these teams, no change of methodology would help because the issues ran deeper. JIRA has been mentioned mostly with negative associations: all 13 mentions of JIRA were in this setting. Being able to get things done without working much with JIRA was mentioned as a positive. Additionally, a recently IPOed, high-growth tech company moved over to JIRA and ran a survey among engineers. It measured a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of -83. This is staggeringly low, and means that 83% of engineers would advise against JIRA. As a counterpoint, an engineering leader at a public tech company with stable growth shared that their organization heavily relies on JIRA, using it as a knowledge engine. In their case, JIRA works well for large-scale coordination, after the organization fully adopted it.,<li>When talking to engineers at Facebook, Whatsapp, Google, Netflix and similar organizations, most of them have never used Scrum. Why? It’s because of a few things: Competent, autonomous people need less structure to produce reliable, high-quality output. Big Tech is able to attract, afford and hire these people. Leveraging competent teams comes through giving them freedom to choose how to operate. This is true for most types of engineering, and there’s good reason why the Skunk Works model of autonomy with reduced bureaucracy, is what many high-performing teams with high-caliber people end up following.,<li>The fewer people you need to make decisions, the faster you can make them. If an engineer only needs to talk to an engineer to decide, that decision will be faster than if the engineer needs to talk to their project manager, who talks to another project manager, who talks to an engineer, who talks to… you get it. ,<li>Optimizing for reporting is optimizing for a low-trust environment. ,<li>Scaling an engineering organization goes well beyond team-level processes, which is another reason most of Big Tech does not push heavyweight team processes. This is not to say these organizations don’t have challenges with productivity, but most of these challenges are not ones that a heavyweight process would solve.,<li>Forming” and “storming” stages of new teams. Psychologist Bruce Tuckman came up with the phrase "forming, storming, norming, and performing” as phases on how groups work. This model very much fits how most engineering teams evolve as well. When a new team is assembled, that team needs to decide how it will work. Reaching for an off-the-shelf approach like Scrum is almost always a better choice to start with, than group members who are unfamiliar with each other coming up with custom processes – or none at all,<li>The lack of dedicated project managers raises several questions. Are engineers overloaded with project management? Is managing projects a good use of engineering time? All of these are possible, and here is my take. For team-level projects, not having a dedicated project manager ends up simplifying processes, and strengthening personal relationships. Engineering project leads will add as little process as they can, as this is in their interest. When collaborating with other teams – also without project managers – they will also build relationships for other engineers leading projects, or owning products. This kind of engineer-to-engineer communication is more efficient than if it went through multiple project managers as well. For complex projects that span several teams across different offices and time zones, leading such a project is a full-time job for an engineer. Big Tech pulls in Technical Project Managers (TPMs) to manage these complex, and often strategic projects, taking the load off engineers. Dedicated Program Managers or Project Managers still exist within Big Tech. They are typically tied to external-facing commitments and customers – such as a Program Manager for the Apple partnership – or to long-running initiatives, like a compliance program. Similar to how TPMs are not allocated to a single engineering team, these Program Managers or Product Managers also don’t tend to have an engineering team, but they work across many teams instead.,<li>Engineers not involved in estimations that the team then committed to, is a frequent pain point. In my view, it’s one of the easiest ways to demotivate engineers – to the point of some leaving – and also to get a false sense of what a team can achieve. Requirements changing, even with dedicated project managers, sits poorly with engineers. While there are teams where requirements change a lot, on these teams it’s typically the engineers who run the projects, and can deal with them. However, when a dedicated project manager is unable to shield the team from requirements changing, respondents rated this approach as poor. Teams with no autonomy to change a failing project management approach also recorded low satisfaction. These kinds of responses were pronounced at companies where all teams were expected to follow the same methodology. It’s an example of directive leadership and while this approach can work well for roles where there is little creativity needed, it is usually a poor way to build high-performing software engineering teams. When teams can iterate together and change their processes on their own terms, satisfaction and productivity go up.,<li>Infrastructure and developer tooling removed the need for many Scrum rituals. Scrum rituals like demoing to the Product Owner, signing off the work and then shipping it, assumes a few things: That the Product Owner is the one who can with certainty validate the work as done to spec. That the Product Owner wrote the spec- because they are validating it. That the work is not being shipped to production before the signoff is done. However, in our environment, these assumptions were often flawed. All code we wrote was tested with unit tests and, where needed, with integration and end-to-end tests. We shipped our code behind feature flags, and validated them with staged rollouts, starting with a rollout to the team. A lot of the “specs” – or tickets – were also written by engineers, who could then validate if they worked as expected. CI/CD, feature flags and experimentation tooling allowed us to have faster feedback cycles than relying on a Product Owner.,<li>With empowered and autonomous teams, managing a project is rarely a top down exercise. Each team will vary, but I’ve found great success in rotating the project lead role among engineers, helping everyone on the team grow their leadership muscle,<li>A few situations where Scrum can be a good alternative: 1. “Kitchen sink teams” which have everything thrown at them, typically find that managing stakeholders with a heavyweight process like Scrum is a win. Stakeholders are educated to understand that an ongoing sprint cannot be interrupted and that new feature requests need to be groomed. Teams with conflicting priorities get to execute with fewer interruptions, thanks to the sprint structure giving space for the team to ignore these interruptions. “Kitchen sink teams” are typical within non-tech companies, where the business has no understanding of how engineering works. Scrum helps rein in the stakeholders and educates them on software development processes, while giving the engineering team breathing room to execute. They are also common in early-stage startups, where there is one engineering team to build everything.,<li>Teams are free to choose the project management methodology they use. Many teams go with an RFC-like planning process, iterate on building, and ship all within a few weeks. Other teams use more Kanban-like processes, where they work on the highest priority items,<li>Iterative changes always work better than ‘big bang’ ones. A European tech company struggling with shipping very slowly hired a new VP of Engineering. This person decided to move the whole organization to a NoEstimates method in the first few months of their tenure. They organized a major event, hired a rock band, and unveiled the new way of working. The following weeks and months were chaos, and the organization reverted to doing what it did beforehand.,<li>The first thing we did was make QA part of engineering. In the “old world”, an engineer would finish their work, check into their branch, update a ticket, and let the QA know it’s ready for review. The QA would take this ticket a day or two later, review it, and reopen the ticket if they found issues. This was a long delay. ,<li>In order to understand how Big Tech manages projects, let’s take a step back and look at the environment most of these companies operate in, which I dive deeper into, in the article What Silicon Valley "Gets" about Software Engineers that Traditional Companies Do Not. Autonomy for software engineers and teams. The expectation of developers at traditional companies is to complete assigned work. At SV-like companies, it's to solve problems that the business has. This is a huge difference. It impacts the day-to-day life of any engineer. Curious problem solvers, not mindless resources. A motivated engineer easily makes multiple times the impact of a "factory worker" who only does what they’re told.  For organizations with a factory worker attitude, this approach will bias towards more heavyweight project management approaches that leave little room for interpretation, on purpose. Internal data, code, and documentation transparency. Employees – and not just engineers – often have access to real time business metrics and data sources, to write their own queries and create custom reports. Exposure to the business and to business metrics. Engineers are encouraged to interact with the rest of the business and build relationships with non-engineers. In contrast, traditional companies often make it impossible for developers to interact with the rest of the business. Engineer-to-engineer comms over triangular-communication. Traditional companies will encourage hierarchical communication that slows down information flow, and results in slower decisions. Investing in a less frustrating developer experience. Companies that care about engineers solving problems quickly set up various platform teams, which reduce the developer experience churn. Higher pay, justified by higher leverage. Companies that leverage engineers well, have no trouble paying close to the top of the market, or above it. Caliber of the talent hired. These companies hire highly competent and highly motivated people, thanks to the combination of all the above. They have a large pool to choose from, as they are known for generous compensation packages, and strong career growth opportunities.</ul><hr />

Here are the high-level definitions of the different components from a product-centric view: Mission: This is a statement that describes the problem you are setting out to solve, typically including who you are solving it for. This is often set at the company level, but can also be defined for a product or product line. Vision: This is the idealized solution that addresses the problem you’ve articulated in your mission. A product vision typically has just enough viability to be relatable, but is still devoid of the details that may hamper your imagination. Product vision is also the goal post and rallying point for your product — it paints the picture of how your product will make an impact. Strategy: This is a set of principles and decisions — informed by reality (e.g. market forces, laws of physics, data) and caveated with assumptions — that you commit to ahead of development to ensure the greatest likelihood of success in achieving your vision. Your strategy may evolve with the introduction of new data. If there’s a big shift in strategy while the mission and vision remain constant, it’s called a pivot. Roadmap: This is the manifestation of your strategy in concrete steps towards your product vision, inclusive of rough milestones and timelines. This, too, often changes given new data. (As I like to say, a roadmap is defunct as soon as it’s published.) Execution: This is the day-to-day activities along the path of the roadmap. This is where you do the hard work to build, launch, and iterate, all the while collecting the necessary data to inform any changes in your roadmap and strategy.,<li>Strategy is a set of principles and decisions — informed by reality (eg. market forces, data) and caveated with assumptions — that you commit to ahead of development to ensure the greatest likelihood of achieving your vision.

<h2>20 Things I’ve Learned in my 20 Years as a Software Engineer, Justin Etheredge, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#102" id="102">&#x23;102</a>, 2021-11-22 10:44:54: You’re about to read a blog post with a lot of advice. Learning from those who came before us is instrumental to success, but we often forget an important caveat. Almost all advice is contextual, yet it is rarely delivered with any context. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/" target="_blank">https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/</a></li><li>7. If you don’t have a good grasp of the universe of what’s possible, you can’t design a good system This is something I struggle with a lot as my responsibilities take me further and further from the day to day of software engineering. Keeping up with the developer ecosystem is a huge amount of work, but it is critical to understand what is possible. If you don’t understand what is possible and what is available in a given ecosystem then you’ll find it impossible to design a reasonable solution to all but the most simple of problems. To summarize, be wary of people designing systems who haven’t written any code in a long time.,<li>Interviews are almost worthless for telling how good of a team member someone will be Interviews are far better spent trying to understand who someone is, and how interested they are in a given field of expertise. Trying to suss out how good of a team member they will be is a fruitless endeavor,<li>Every system eventually sucks, get over it Bjarne Stroustrup has a quote that goes “There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses”. This can be extended to large systems as well. There is no “right” architecture, you’ll never pay down all of your technical debt, you’ll never design the perfect interface, your tests will always be too slow. This isn’t an excuse to never make things better, but instead a way to give you perspective. Worry less about elegance and perfection; instead strive for continuous improvement and creating a livable system that your team enjoys working in and sustainably delivers value.,<li>One of the biggest differences between a senior engineer and a junior engineer is that they’ve formed opinions about the way things should be Nothing worries me more than a senior engineer that has no opinion of their tools or how to approach building software. I’d rather someone give me opinions that I violently disagree with than for them to have no opinions at all. If you are using your tools, and you don’t love or hate them in a myriad of ways, you need to experience more,<li>There are a lot of forces that will push you to build the bigger system up-front. Budget allocation, the inability to decide which features should be cut, the desire to deliver the “best version” of a system. All of these things push us very forcefully towards building too much. You should fight this. You learn so much as you’re building a system that you will end up iterating into a much better system than you ever could have designed in the first place. This is surprisingly a hard sell to most people</ul><hr />

<h2>136 facts every web dev should know before they burn out and turn to landscape painting or nude modelling, Baldur Bjarnason, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#105" id="105">&#x23;105</a>, 2021-11-22 11:40:20: Everything I’ve learned about web development in the almost twenty-five years I’ve been practising. All boiled down into a neat little list that I put together over a week. I’m Icelandic, so I’m prone to absolute statements. It’s a cultural thing. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2021/100-things-every-web-developer-should-know/" target="_blank">https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2021/100-things-every-web-developer-should-know/</a></li><li>Individual teams or individual developers don’t have that problem, so they get less value from a web dev framework. The more opinionated the framework is and the more of the web platform it abstracts away, the more its value proposition skews towards solving organisational problems and the less value it provides to individual teams. ,<li>The job of development is to build a theory in your mind about the codebase.,<li>Working on a functioning app’s codebase does more to increase its quality than adding features.,<li>Svelte and Typescript are very useful, but the cost of building is always more than you think, especially once the codebase grows.,<li>Every SPA I’ve ever used has at some point let me down when it comes to navigation or history management: Resetting a view when you click the back button (browsers have an excellent back-forward cache! Use it!). Not loading the correct view. Failing to load a part of the screen. Losing data/context when opening a link in a new tab. Or just giving up altogether. They all fuck up at some point. Server-routed sites aren’t perfect, but there’s a lot less that can go wrong.  ,<li>Web dev is pop culture. You have two choices: keep up with the trends or have enough individuality to be timeless. (Which is easier said than done, though.),<li>Most project management software is garbage because organisations generally don’t lack the tools to manage work. You could replace most project management software with a spreadsheet with no issue. The problem all organisations have, which most think is a project management problem, is team and organisation communications.,<li>The first rule of SPAs: we always underestimate the complexity of handling state. Often by a large margin. The second rule of SPAs: we always underestimate the complexity of reimplementing history and link navigation. Often by a large margin. But we get away with not caring because nobody tests history management properly.,<li>Any field where all of the other competitors have five (or more) salespeople for every developer isn’t going to be pleasant for the developer, no matter if they’re an employee or a founder. Probably great if you’re a salesperson, though.,<li>Minimalism is garbage. Simplicity is great, but minimalism sucks. Everything you see on the screen should have a reason to be there (be an embodiment of ‘doing’), but if the reasons are complicated, then the design should represent that complexity. Hiding complications makes everything harder, and excessive minimalism is just as harmful as excessive decoration.,<li>Never go up against a free service from a multinational. At least, never directly. Try to position yourself so that the free services from other companies complement your paid service. ,<li>Web dev frameworks are for organisations, not small software teams or individual developers. The value frameworks provide lies in bridging team boundaries: they create a shared understanding that aids in collaboration across groups, simplify messaging, and establish clear conventions. Frameworks turn teams in large organisations into service interfaces.,<li>Avoid using web workers (the web stack’s equivalent for a process) or threads if you can. They make theory-building harder.,<li>Any field with multiple successful competitors is good news. It means that there is demand, which you can tap in by addressing the problem in your way,<li>Working on an iffy codebase (and they all start iffy) to make it cleaner, more sensible, and more robust without adding features or functionality can save you weeks if not months of future work.,<li>Sturgeon’s law applies to your work as well. Don’t linger on one project forever. Make new things. That’s the only way to learn. ,<li>Most products don’t need the features that SPAs provide. Teams need SPAs but not for the product itself. SPAs make for great demos and lovely presentations, which leads to more support for the team, more funding, and that way, SPAs improve the odds of success.,<li>Once you have a working app, working on code quality is just as likely to provide as much business value as a new feature.,<li>The only exception to this is when a brand new technical innovation opens up a new field. Which is rarer than you think as a better design doesn’t qualify as sufficient innovation. Unless you are the one who spent years developing that innovation from scratch, you are only performing arbitrage. That’s a recipe for squashed margins and brutal competition.,<li>Web dev is pop culture. Don’t get too stuck on trend-du-jour. Give it enough time and what was old is new again.,<li>Fuck ups happen. Nobody is to blame even when somebody is responsible. Use it as an opportunity to see where the process didn’t work. And if you don’t have a process—well, that’s what’s wrong. Right? </ul><hr />
<h2>Join the AMAZING CTO newsletter like many others!, Stephan Schmidt, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#106" id="106">&#x23;106</a>, 2021-12-06 05:13:05: A coachee recently wanted to make their process less waterfally. He wanted to talk about a new process that was less waterfall than their current one - they were doing Scrum. This made me wonder why we always end up with waterfall and how to fix it. I realized a new process will not be sufficient. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/why-we-always-endup-with-waterfall-even-scrum/" target="_blank">https://www.amazingcto.com/why-we-always-endup-with-waterfall-even-scrum/</a></li><li>Sadly, I haven’t seen many product owners, most are product managers that manage external stakeholders.,<li>Those stakeholders drive the product, madly pulling the steering wheel to the right and left. These external stake holders want predictability, because they don’t care about the product but see the product as a tool for their goals. When will it be ready? The stake holders queue up in a long line. And just like in Disneyland where it says “60 min from here” they want to know when “their” feature is developed. This drives waterfall. To coordinate and communicate about the queue product management draws up roadmaps. With a roadmap the product team will sprint ahead and work on future things – for the sake of efficiency. “I can already work on the UI of the next feature”. Efficiency is the key driver for waterfall. In a culture of permanent business pressure with a long queue of stakeholders everything gets sacrificed on the altar of efficiency. Efficiency drives waterfall into everything.,<li>Why work on things together as a team? Why work together on designing the feature? We write the code while you draw the UI. Product is two sprints ahead, design is one sprint ahead, developers write the code and QA – if there is QA – is one sprint behind. Waterfall kills agile because you can’t change course with a queue and roadmaps.</ul><hr />
<h2>Product Roadmaps for CTOs, Stephan Schmidt, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#107" id="107">&#x23;107</a>, 2021-12-15 08:27:48: How does a developer know what to code? Most companies guide development with a roadmap. This ignores agile principles and leads to waterfall processes. Roadmaps only work with deadlines which make developers feel miserable without need and leads to unsuccessful products. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/product-roadmaps-cto-technology/" target="_blank">https://www.amazingcto.com/product-roadmaps-cto-technology/</a></li><li>Roadmaps are pacifiers, they keep people calm and shut up, “my feature is on the roadmap”. They are there so someone didn’t have to say no. They pawn the future to happiness in the present. Instead of all of this, say No! Steve Jobs told employees in 1997 when he killed a feature Apples developer loved:,<li>Have a dedicated team for marketing and other departments, which only builds marketing integrations and landing pages. Your product teams focus on building the product. This will remove the pressure to put things on a roadmap, as often marketing wants a roadmap and their features on the roadmap so they are – rightfully - not forgotten and can plan their campaigns. Decouple marketing campaign planning from building successful products.,<li>Start each quarter with an empty table - tabula rasa - and not with a backlog or a roadmap filled with features and products. Build what needs to be built in that moment. Do what need to be done for the success of your company in the marketplace. For developing features and products push down responsibility as far as possible. Self-organized product teams decide what to build. Self-organized product teams decide what not to build. Self-organized, cross functional teams are responsible for the success of their work. They are guided by objectives which help them to make decisions.,<li>Roadmaps only work with deadlines which make developers feel miserable without need and leads to unsuccessful products. Therefore, you have to say: No, no, no!,<li>Roadmaps are also driven by the desire for control. If you do not have a roadmap, what will developers build? Managers do not trust their departments; CEOs do not trust their companies to build the right things. With a roadmap, managers can feel in control. </ul><hr />
<h2>The Skill of Org Design, Cedric Chin, 2021</h2>
    <aside><a href="#108" id="108">&#x23;108</a>, 2021-12-15 08:44:08: I built my first organisation when I was in high school. It was a debate club, and it died the instant I graduated and left for university. I remember looking back on the experience and thinking to myself: “Hmm, this is interesting. How do you build an org that outlasts you?” </aside><ul><li><a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/org-design-skill/" target="_blank">https://commoncog.com/blog/org-design-skill/</a></li><li>So the way I ran certain org changes was to: Get a sense for team receptivity for that org change, balanced against the necessity of the org change. If I sensed that the team would be resistant to the change, I would: Figure out how much I had left in the ‘credibility/trust’ bank, and if I wanted to burn that capital. If possible, find a smaller, more reversible version of the org change to introduce first. Use disasters to my full advantage (people are usually more receptive to trying new ways of doing things in the wake of something painful). Strategically allow certain things to blow up so that I could exploit the pain to introduce org change, as per 4) above. Or build consensus; consensus was always the best, if most time consuming, option. ,<li>Organisational design is a design problem. Like all design problems, the nature of the problem is a search for form-context fit. In other words, you are attempting to find some ‘form’ (an org ‘shape’, or a combination of systems, processes, and culture) that allows you to achieve some set of goals, given the specific constraints in which the org operates (the ‘context’). The key difficulty with this task is that organisations are complex adaptive systems,<li>Systems thinking means a particular thing here: you are able to predict how people are going to respond to incentives. I mean incentives broadly: there are psychological and status incentives, created by the structure of your org and the people in it, and there are also economic incentives, that fall out of your promotion and compensation policies.,<li>economic incentives, b) ‘contractual’ obligations, and c) culture. These three tools make up your org design toolbox.,<li>The Three Modes of Organisational Control In High Output Management, Andy Grove argues that there are really only three forms of organisational control: Economic incentives (what Grove calls ‘free-market forces’) — for instance when you purchase something for a price, or take economically motivated action with your self-interests in mind. Contractual obligations — when you stop for a traffic light, or work within prescribed roles in a company — say, if you are in marketing, and you have to work with sales (Hubspot sales leader Mark Roberge calls this ‘the sales-marketing service level agreement’, which is usually implicit in most companies). Culture — when you are influenced by ‘this is the way we do things here.’ ,<li>How did you do it? Or more importantly, how do you get good at org design?” And I said: “I don’t know. I just did what felt right.”</ul><hr />

This fear is unfounded. As argued, when an individual’s work volume increases, so does the accompanying overhead and stress, reducing both the time remaining to actually execute the tasks and the quality of the results. ,<li>The bigger challenge of Slow Productivity is that it requires systems to manage work that’s not yet assigned. If you’re a boss, and an important task pops to mind—“We need to update our Web site with new client testimonials!”—you can no longer simply e-mail the request to one of your underlings and move on with your day. Slow Productivity would require you to log this item into a system where it can be properly prioritized and ultimately assigned when the right person has the needed time available.,<li>If you instead enable the individual to work more sequentially, focussing on a small number of things at a time, waiting until she is done before bringing on new obligations, the rate at which she completes tasks might actually increase.</ul><hr />

<h2>Tips On Prioritizing Tech Debt In A Healthy Way, Csaba Okrona, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#121" id="121">&#x23;121</a>, 2022-02-11 01:10:56: Technical debt (a.k.a. 'tech debt') became a popular term in the past years. Our codebases and systems tend to build up 'cruft' over time, making it harder to make changes to them or build on them later. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://leadership.garden/tips-on-prioritizing-tech-debt/" target="_blank">https://leadership.garden/tips-on-prioritizing-tech-debt/</a></li><li>Some examples of phrasing technical debt around risk: We might fix a bug in 2 places but miss the 3rd due to code duplication. The design of the current system could lead to a slow user experience at higher usage scenarios. Lacking security practices could result in breaches and legal liabilities. Accidental introduction of new bugs into the feature is probable due to our lack of unit tests. The complexity and inflexibility of the codebase result in us saying no to new features due to long development times,<li>ICE and RICE scoring You end up with many items of different sizes and impacts – then it becomes very chaotic. ICE can help bring order to this chaos by a methodical approach to assessing these items and creating a single numerical representation of their priority based on which you can simply sort them. ICE stands for Impact, Confidence, and Ease/Effort. The R in RICE stands for Reach. For each of these factors, the team agrees on a set of numerical points, e.g. Massive = 3 High = 2, Medium = 1, Low = 0.5, Minimal = 0.25 Impact - What impact would solving this issue have on the customers (remember, customers can be internal too!) - or, when thinking about risk, what impact would not solving the issue have? Confidence - How confident are you in your estimation of the impact (and optionally the ease/effort)? Ease/Effort - Effort is usually easier to talk about - how much effort would it take to solve the issue? Remember that it's a relative metric, comparable only across the other issues in the current batch. Reach - How many people will this impact? 100% of your customer base? Only a specific persona? It's important to understand that these scores are only meaningful in the local, relative context and should not be compared across domains. Once you have the numbers, the calculation is easy: RICE score = (Impact x Confidence) / Effort or Impact x Confidence x Ease,<li>The myth of the two backlogs Let's start with what not to do. Many teams end up with two kinds of backlogs – one product-focused and one tech-focused. It won't work for multiple reasons:  It'll be nearly impossible to cross-prioritize items in separate backlogs against each other. It fuels the "us vs. them" mindset, which kills team cohesion and common goals. Prioritization is the job of the whole team; leaving out Product representatives won't work. It makes sprint planning harder unless you have strict rules on how to allocate capacity (e.g., 20% goes to tech debt consistently) </ul><hr />

<h2>Unlearning Perfectionism, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#123" id="123">&#x23;123</a>, 2022-02-11 01:10:58: There is a common idea that perfectionism is the need for perfect results: the maximum test score, the flawless recital, the unanimous verdict. But this idea misses the deeper reality. More generally, perfectionism is the tendency to stake your identity on achieving fixed outcomes. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://arunkprasad.com/log/unlearning-perfectionism/" target="_blank">https://arunkprasad.com/log/unlearning-perfectionism/</a></li><li>More prosaically, the tendency correlates with a stunning number of maladaptive patterns, often as a cause. Here are four:  Procrastination through fear of failure and delaying complex uncertain tasks. The perfectionist procrastinates to avoid confronting her imperfection. She is also slow to ask for help because doing so would mean admitting that she's struggling.   Impostor syndrome as the fear of being found out and judged unworthy: not smart, not capable, not good enough to meet an ideal standard. The perfectionist blends in and acts the part for fear of being found out and rejected.   Obsessive compulsion, both as full OCD and in its milder forms. For example, the recurring anxious fear of inadequacy leads to the self-soothing response of scrolling Twitter for an hour.   Burnout, which some see as a kind of PTSD. A defenseless perfectionist that chronically fails to live up to her ideal endures deep emotional trauma. In the worst case, she loses all sense of self-worth.,<li>One alternative with a similar flavor is excellence, which differs in two respects:  Where perfectionism focuses on achieving, excellence focuses on pursuing. Success and failure aren't ever in our full control. All we can control is what we choose to do right now, in this moment. Our attention shifts from outcomes to process.   Where perfectionism focuses on fixed outcomes, excellence focuses on better outcomes. Any real situation can always be improved. Since there is no perfect outcome, perfection is impossible.  ,<li>The perfectionist fears setbacks, uncertainty, true knowledge of her strengths and weaknesses, failure that can't be blamed on others, and anything else that threatens her outcomes or her fixed sense of self. She deprives herself of the explosive growth that comes from uncertainty, struggle, and open exploration. Like a tree that grows only as large as its pot, she hews to the familiar and stunts her potential. She is theory over practice; dreaming over acting; resentment over curiosity; fantasy over reality. She dwells in puddles for fear of the ocean.,<li>None of these outcomes are problems. But they become so when they intertwine with our identity and self-worth. If a perfectionist of fame ever feels unknown, then he feels worthless and ashamed. Hence the perfectionist stakes his identity on achieving his outcomes, meaning his self-worth depends on realizing them. This is a pitiful wager and a poor strategy. Above all, perfectionism is a tendency, not a law. With practice, we can unlearn it and replace it with far better approaches. If you clearly see this tendency in yourself, you then have a choice: to reinforce it through your actions, or to unlearn it and practice something better. Either way, it's your decision. </ul><hr />

The person breaking production isn't at fault here. A whole team focused on other priorities Was this for the right reasons? (eg release pressure?) Or the wrong ones? (lacking sophistication?),<li>your job is not to manage people but to manage processes and lead people  You manage processes on how you expect work to be done, where each person's authority starts and ends, how their careers are made, and how all this can be discussed, and/or changed Additionally, you are leading people by example and through empathy. They have goals, fears and motivations. Frequently also problems outside of work. Act how you would want them to act if the role would be reversed.  ,<li>Don't confuse autonomy and abandonment I frequently meet founders who hire people "and get out of their way" While this is principle correct it doesn't absolve you from enabling them to succeed ,<li>In every discussion/project/problem/situation, it needs to be clear who makes decisions …everyone else only adds opinions.

    <aside><a href="#125" id="125">&#x23;125</a>, 2022-02-11 02:46:17: With help of Ergodox keyboard and Colemak layout I changed my typing habits and saved my wrists from severe pain.

The home row keys on my keyboard as act letters when I tap them, but when I press and hold them they act as modifier keys (Cmd, Opt, Ctrl). This allows me to use common shortcuts like Cmd+C (copy) or Cmd+S (save) without having to reach keys in the most bottom row of the keyboard. Instead my shortcuts are N+C (copy) or N+S (save). It required some trial and error, but it's been a real game changer for me. Here's my current setup if you're curious.</ul><hr />

    <aside><a href="#127" id="127">&#x23;127</a>, 2022-02-11 05:44:31: In Singapore, and Malaysia, and India, and Vietnam, if you’re a young software engineer fresh out of college, you have effectively three choices for a first job: You can go work for a product company, one where the tech is the focus. This is most likely a startup. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-consulting-business-model/" target="_blank">https://commoncog.com/blog/the-consulting-business-model/</a></li><li>The top performers must have special client-facing skills, which in turn places a heavy burden on the firm to recruit and train the best people in your field with such client-management skills (if you’re familiar with Joe Average Programmer, you should know that this is a lot harder than it sounds). In turn, this forces the professional firm to actively compete in two markets: the ‘input’ market for talent, and the ‘output’ market for its services. ,<li>This implies that the firm’s people strategy must stem from its project mix.,<li>For any given rate of growth, a highly leveraged firm (one with a high ratio of juniors to seniors) will offer a lower probability of “making it” to the top, since there are many juniors seeking to rise and relatively few senior slots opening up. A less leveraged firm, at the same rate of growth, will need to “bring along” a higher percentage of its juniors, thus providing a greater promotion incentive. (emphasis added),<li>Brain’-type projects eventually turn into ‘Grey Hair’ projects. What is once cutting-edge becomes cookie-cutter — Maister calls this the ‘life-cycle’ of the client market. Therefore, ‘Brain’-oriented firms must either evolve their firm structure to attack ‘Grey Hair’ projects, or they must continually seek new frontiers to apply their expertise in order to maintain their current firm shape.,<li>In other words: if a firm doesn’t change its project mix, then to remain successful it must get rid of staff over time. ,<li>Must the firm grow? Yes, it must. Recall that people join professional service firms for a career, not for a job.

<h2>Practical Guide to Solving Hard Problems, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#129" id="129">&#x23;129</a>, 2022-03-05 09:39:13: I sometimes find myself in a position of needing to write some code that I’m just not sure how to write. Been there have you? Here are the steps I take when I’m stumped. No huge revelations here, just hard-earned advice. Think hard about the problem for a few weeks before typing any code. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://praeclarum.org/2022/02/19/hard-problems.html" target="_blank">https://praeclarum.org/2022/02/19/hard-problems.html</a></li><li>No huge revelations here, just hard-earned advice.  Think hard about the problem for a few weeks before typing any code.   Type in a function or write a class that has the inputs and outputs you need.   Break the function down into multiple steps with clear objectives. You may not know how to achieve those objectives, but that’s a problem for your future self. Right now, you’re just trying to write out the high-level algorithm.   Create a function for each of those steps and throw new NotImplementedException() in each of them. Their names should be long and explanatory and there should be no question about what’s expected of them. It’s really OK if you don’t actually know how to write ‘em.   Now, go implement a few of those functions. You know they’re not all hard. Some may even be fun! Build up your confidence and implement the easy ones. It feels good to make progress and it lets the analytical part of your brain run in the background for a bit while you focus on nitty grid number types and file IO.   Time to tackle some of those harder functions. Go into each of those and break the problem down into steps just like you did before. You’re right, I’m gonna say it: Rinse and repeat. Keep breaking those hard problems down into steps. Turn each of those steps into a function with a clear name. Implement the easy ones. Then break the hard ones down into steps again. Do this over and over again. You’ll be surprised how much you can actually get done.   Pretty soon (haha) you will have an 80% complete solution with just a few pesky functions left that throw NotImplemented. Now go scour your favorite package repository, or code repository, or question and answer site, or artificial intelligence programming assistant for implementations. Chances are you’re not the first person to need this particular function or widget. Find some giants, climb on top of them, and scream “Holy shit, there are a lot of smart programmers in the world!”   OK, you’ve scoured the inter webs and yet you still have a few pesky NotImplemented exceptions. It’s time to check on those scientists. Enter every SEO permutation of your problem statement into arXiv. Surely others have worked on problems related to one you are trying to solve. They will most likely offer insights or perspective shifts that can help you reframe your problem into something solvable. Do that. Reframe your problem and knock out those NotImplementeds.   Now you’re in trouble. If you still have a few NotImplemented exceptions, and there are no giants upon which to stand nor academics obsessing over this particular field, then it’s all up to you. Think big. Think outside the box. Your career depends on it. (Just kidding, I hope.) Perhaps a bath will help you think?  I think these are steps all programmers take, but sometimes it’s good to spell it out.</ul><hr />

I dream of a place where financiers understand my desire to take risks, a place where not only engineers have empathy towards the business but vice versa. It's there where I'd waste your hard-earned dollars on days of "unnecessary" and tangential work. It's where I'd rent servers to compute seemingly useless shit - where I'd blow tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere just to gather more, to you, irrelevant information. If I had all the creative freedom in the world, I'd do "terrible" things with the money you invested.,<li>VCs are sheep.

<h2>Why is selling software so weird?, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#136" id="136">&#x23;136</a>, 2022-04-15 12:57:46: If you squint enough, building software looks a lot like building a house. In both cases, you start with a problem and Frankenstein together various components using rules of thumb until you have something that looks like a solution. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.zeptonaut.com/posts/selling-software-is-weird/" target="_blank">https://www.zeptonaut.com/posts/selling-software-is-weird/</a></li><li>for each few percentile you move to the right on that curve of outcomes, the value you’re creating increases exponentially. To achieve this, you need to not only build high quality software but also understand adjacent ideas like identifying promising distribution channels, soliciting and incorporating customer feedback, and building defensible moats around your business.,<li>First is that software takes a lot of time to write up-front. By the time you’ve signed up your first customer at $10/month, there’s a good chance you’ve spent 100s or 1000s of hours writing that software. Low volume software is not a good business to be in.,<li>Contrast this with software, which lives in the realm of often-near-zero marginal costs. I can’t make a living building Zoom for someone because Zoom already did that. The marginal cost to Zoom of onboarding a new customer is almost zero, whereas the fixed cost to me of recreating Zoom is astronomical.,<li>If you’re building software - particularly new software that hasn’t already found a market -this underscores the importance of being good at what you do: if you’re just average (or more precisely, just median), you’re creating zero value.,<li>The second downside of the “high-leverage” software model is that unless you aggressively seek out feedback, you’ll probably realize that your software sucks only after you’ve built it and can’t find a customer. The digital nature of software makes it extremely easy to ignore pesky distractions like customers right up until the moment you need their money to buy that expensive Icelandic yogurt you love.</ul><hr />

When you view effective communication across groups as a “defect,” the solutions to your problems start to look quite different from traditional ones,<li>The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than “writing” a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what, and how things are related.,<li>Amazon innovation called “single-threaded leadership,” in which a single person, unencumbered by competing responsibilities, owns a single major initiative and heads up a separable, largely autonomous team to deliver its goals. In this chapter we’ll explain what these terms mean, how they came to be, and why they lie at the heart of the Amazon approach to innovation and high-velocity decision-making.  ,<li>, Jeff’s vision was that we needed to focus on loosely coupled interaction via machines through well-defined APIs rather than via humans through emails and meetings.

This offers some powerful advantages:,<li>For each fresh interview cycle, I create a set of predict-the-output exercises that start really easy, then get harder. My current set starts off with a basic function call, then multi-level function calls, then recursion, then side-effects. These are generally “pretend” functions that are meant to give the candidate some quick success and give me some clues on how the rest of the interview will go. For more advanced questions, I pull code from stuff I’ve written. My current “hard” questions explore ability to make abstractions while reading and also following asynchronous operations,<li>At the start of the interview, I explain: I’m NOT testing knowledge of syntax. Treat me like an AI-enabled google and I will just tell you what some function or operator does. I don’t expect you to finish because nobody does. We will stop after 20 minutes. I don’t expect you to get answers correct. If the answer is wrong, I would love to see you go back and debug your thinking. This is just as valuable to me as anything else.</ul><hr />

Once your business starts to succeed, is there something that will prevent competitors from just copying you?,<li>Coming up with a good startup idea is a three step process. You need to find a problem, find a way in which technology can help solve that problem, and then analyze your solution to see if you can build a good business around it. When it invariably turns out that your idea sucks, there’s a fourth step where you soak that idea with gasoline and light it on fire.</ul><hr />

Self-awareness is critical; your blind spots and rough corners can hurt other people. Always be reflecting. Always be learning.      ,<li>Managing comes first Most managers are strong executors. They may inherit executional responsibilities, have the tendency to fall back on executing to solve problems, or want to let execution take priority. Managing comes first. Management can require large blocks of time, sometimes without warning, which means it’s crucial to stay out of the critical path of execution, wherever possible.,<li>Distribute problems, not solutions Managers with excellent execution skills and deep domain knowledge must resist the urge to present solutions to their reports. Reports learn by discovering solutions. Create safe learning opportunities. Create time for learning to occur. Give constraints, and justifications for the constraints. </ul><hr />

Propose a course of action   Remind yourself: what I was trying to do?   Ask the question: does doing this solve my problem? Doing this should transform your problem into your imaginary solved problem (that’s why it’s important to have an idea of how does the solved problem looks like)   Do I need to do this? All actions should be needed for solving the problem. Any action that is not obviously needed, should be discarded</ul><hr />

For example, I once managed twelve people as an engineering manager and my boss, a director, managed around that many managers himself, the pattern continuing up to the CTO. So if you envision being part of the C-suite yourself someday, then out-competing the 12^N people below the CTO or CPO is a brutal way to do it.,<li>Market pressures don’t apply to internal teams, which can be both good and bad.,<li>At a tech company, especially a large one, you will specialize. You may become an expert in a particular subsystem or a particular layer of the stack and then good luck telling your mom what you do. In a staff role at a non-tech company, you will likely have a much larger but shallower scope. You may talk to the stakeholders, make changes to the frontend, build that backend, and keep the database up. Depending on the size of the place, you may do all of that in a single day, and spend time getting familiar with the intricacies of the business your company operates in.</ul><hr />

People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters. If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you.

<h2>Thinking in Bets: How to Make Decisions Like a Poker Player, Frontera, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#149" id="149">&#x23;149</a>, 2022-06-08 01:45:43: Thinking in bets is a decision-making framework developed by former professional poker player Annie Duke. In this article, you’ll find two real-life examples of how people —mistakenly— evaluate decisions based on their outcomes. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://fronterablog.com/thinking-in-bets/" target="_blank">https://fronterablog.com/thinking-in-bets/</a></li><li>Life is a decision-making game. Investments, what projects to work on, career changes… The better decisions you make over the long term, the more successful you get. But people make one common mistake while assessing their decisions. They judge the quality of the decisions based on the outcomes. And this is a flaw that creates a dangerous illusion for future decisions. Because life is not chess. It’s poker. Luck plays a bigger role than you think.,<li>Professional poker players decide to bet (or not) on a hand by calculating the expected value of the bet. Let’s say there is $300 in the pot — that’s the total money you can earn. You need $50 to call your opponent’s bet and you estimate a 25% chance of having the winning hand. So the expected value of that bet would be 25% of the $300, which is $75. Since the expected value ($75) is higher than the bet ($50), it makes sense to bet 50 bucks for that hand. Do the same for your life decisions.,<li>Another way to make better decisions is to examine your past choices. But remember, regardless of the outcome. What made you win big in that investment? Your good decision or luck? Was starting that business a good decision despite the failure? If you don’t find your mistakes, you run the risk of repeating them. </ul><hr />

This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life." - Steve Jobs,<li>I've also noticed that, up to a certain point, the smarter a person is, the more it has to be apparent in their work.

He was the most powerful man in the world. He had all the social status, all the money, and he could do anything he wanted. Even with all that, he was looking forward to the day that he could step down and retire from it all. The man with all the power in the world was happiest when he thought about the day he could let go of all the power.8 How foolish is it to spend your life chasing fame, riches, and power, while being unhappy the entire time, even after you achieve it? What is the point of it all? To impress other people? Is that really worth it in the end?,<li> You should organize each day as if it were your last, so that you neither need to long for nor fear the next day. You should avoid spending time on people and things that don’t really matter to you. You should be very thrifty with your time, because you know there’s nothing for which it is worth exchanging.11 What I was trying to say before was just because someone’s always busy, and lives to an old age, doesn’t mean they’ve lived long. They’ve just existed long.,<li>he most surprising thing is that you wouldn’t let anyone steal your property, but you consistently let people steal your time, which is infinitely more valuable.2 No one is willing to hand out their money randomly, but that’s exactly what you do with your time.

<h2>Why long-term plans don't work and how to fix them, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#172" id="172">&#x23;172</a>, 2022-07-24 23:25:43: Yearly software development plans are my favourite genre of fiction. In the fabulous world of yearly plans, product developers assume they know exactly what product they must build and how long each task will take. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://lucasfcosta.com/2022/07/15/long-term-plans-dont-work.html" target="_blank">https://lucasfcosta.com/2022/07/15/long-term-plans-dont-work.html</a></li><li>Before I enumerate alternatives to a long-term plan, first, let me tell you shouldn’t do: Plan more carefully Add a larger margin of error The problem with planning more carefully is that no matter how carefully you plan, you will still get estimates wrong because of the reasons listed above. If anything, planning more carefully will yield greater cost and frustration. Greater cost because you’ll spend time planning and preparing for a wide variety of events, and greater frustration because you’ll get those events wrong anyway,<li>Instead of making your plan better, make it shorter. Making plans shorter was the part of the Agile manifest everyone missed. Remember “responding to change over following a plan”? The whole point of Agile was to run into walls as quickly as you could, just so that you could map out where the walls were and stop hitting your head against them.,<li>Notice I’m not telling you to break your long-term plan into smaller increments. A long-term plan broken down into sprints is still a long-term plan! Instead, I’m telling you to either scrape your long-term plan altogether or avoid adding detail to longer-term goals. Moreover, I’m telling you to be open to changing those long-term goals as new pieces of information arise, either good or bad. As your planning horizons diminish, your risks do too.,<li>Furthermore, in the world of car manufacturing, value is created by producing more cars in less time for lower prices. In that world, car companies estimate and optimise manufacturing, not design. In the world of software development, manufacturing is not a challenge. In fact, replicating and distributing software is virtually free. The problem with software development is that we try to forecast how long it will take for us to design features, not to replicate them. Because every new feature is — obviously — new, there’s just no way of knowing how long feature development will take unless we actually do it. Moreover, while manufacturing poses operational risks, design poses product risks. When manufacturing is poorly managed, you have fewer products to sell or narrower profit margins, but you still have a product people are willing to buy because you’re past the design stage. On the other hand, when a product is poorly designed, it doesn’t matter how efficient its manufacturing and distribution are because no one is willing to buy it.,<li>the long-term plan approach is comparable to placing a bet on a horse race. When you go to the hippodrome, you must choose a horse before the race even starts, and you must stick to it all the way until the end. Besides cheering and praying, you can do nothing to help the chosen horse win the race. Just like winning the pot in a horse race, when the long-term plan succeeds, it’s not because of its competent executors; it’s because of a sheer stroke of luck.</ul><hr />
<h2>The Einstein Principle: Accomplish More By Doing Less, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#173" id="173">&#x23;173</a>, 2022-07-24 23:37:44: Between the years 1912 to 1915, Albert Einstein was a focused man.

We would each have only one, or at most two, projects in the three major spheres of our lives: professional, extracurricular, and personal. And we would be allowed to focus on this specialized set, in exclusion, as we push the projects to impressive conclusions. ,<li>We are most productive when we focus on a very small number of projects on which we can devote a large amount of attention.,<li>Achievements worth achieving require hard work. There is no shortcut here. Be it starting up a new college club or starting a new business, eventually, effort, sustained over a long amount of time, is required.,<li>In Search of Your Own Theory of Relativity,<li>When it feels like your schedule is becoming too overwhelmed, take out a sheet of paper and label it with three columns: professional, extracurricular, and personal. Under “professional” list all the major projects you are currently working on in your professional life (if you’re a student, then this means classes and research, if you have a job, then this means your job, etc). Under “extracurricular” do the same for your side projects (your band, your blog, your plan to write a book). And under “personal” do the same for personal self-improvement projects (from fitness to reading more books). Under each list try to select one or two projects which, at this point in your life, are the most important and seem like they would yield the greatest returns. Put a star by these projects. Next, identify the projects that you could stop working on right away with no serious consequences. Cross these out. Finally, for the projects that are left unmarked, come up with a 1-3 week plan for finalizing and dispatching them. Many of these will be projects for which you owe someone something before you can stop working on them. Come up with a crunch plan for the near future for shutting these down as quickly as possible. Once you completed your crunch plan you’ll be left with only a small number of important projects. In essence, you have purged your schedule of all but a few contenders to be your next Theory of Relativity. Here’s the important part: Try to go at least one month without starting any new projects. Resist, at all costs, committing to anything during this month. Instead, just focus, with an Einsteinian intensity, on your select list.,<li>Our problem is that we don’t know in advance which project might turn out to be our theory of relativity and which are duds. Because of this, most ambitious people I know, myself included, follow a different strategy. We sow lots of project seeds. We e-mail a lot of people, join a lot of clubs, commit to a lot of minor projects, set up lots of meetings, constantly send out feelers to friends and connections regarding our latest brainstorm. We don’t know which seed will ultimately take root and grow, so, by planting many, we expose ourselves to enough randomness, over time, to maximize our chance of a big deal, interesting, life-changing success eventually happening. These numerous seeds, however, have a tendency to transform into weeds. While some of them clearly grow into pursuits worth continuing, and others die off quickly, many, instead, exist in a shadowy in-between state where they demand our time but offer little promise of reward in the end.,<li>Imagine if Einstein maintained a blog, wrote a book, joined a bunch of clubs at ETH, and tried to master rowing at the same time he was working on General Relativity? We’d still be living in the age of Newton.</ul><hr />

Many marketers choose this somewhere to be the homepage. I think this is almost always not the best place to direct people.    Actually, I think many campaigns show no return on investment because of this.</ul><hr />

All success stories are propaganda. We can and must make our own way. ,<li>But above all accept the truth that you are alone. There are no heroes or gods who can tell us what to do. There is nobody who’s figured it all, who can save us the hard work and the risk. Nobody has the keys to wisdom and certainty. ,<li>Whatever the reason, for the most part these stories (Steve Jobs’ included) have nothing to teach us. Painting false realities, creating the illusion that success is far easier than it actually is, and laying claim to universal wisdom, they enslave us in the fictions, fantasies and ideologies of others. Comforting though it might be, they stop us thinking for ourselves. ,<li>So if you’re on the receiving end of a Self Made success story exercise extreme caution.</ul><hr />

    <aside><a href="#179" id="179">&#x23;179</a>, 2022-07-26 19:13:51: I'm making a living by writing, full-time. My newsletter is the #1 paid technology newsletter on Substack.

With remote work becoming more common in tech, I get more and more messages from people asking the same: how can they do what I do? </aside><ul><li><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-to-become-a-full-time-creator/" target="_blank">https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-to-become-a-full-time-creator/</a></li><li>Most creators are B2C (business to consumer), bootstrapped businesses. They typically make their revenue through selling: Own digital products and subscriptions. For example, this is how former Stripe engineer Julia Evans makes a living creating Wizard Zines which are visual programming explainers. In 2019 she already made more than $30,000 in a month. Small software products that can be built by one person. These include apps, games, SaaS software and many others. For example, software engineer Riley Tomasek started to build Standard Resume as a resume generator when he applied for tech companies. This was the tool that got him his job at Dropbox. A few years later, this side project grew to $5,000/month in revenue and Riley later quit his fulltime job, and is currently working on this product. Sponsorships and advertising. This is a typical model of how many creators with a large audience monetize the fact that many people pay attention to them. Affiliates - where they get a cut of all sales.,<li>A much better model for the "sustainable creator" is creating on the side of the one-person business. ,<li>People who create content that has a wide reach often start with ads, sponsorships, and affiliates as their income streams. Those starting off with a more specific niche tend to start off with subscriptions, sponsorships, courses, or books as streams,<li>Books are an interesting area, as they don’t sound terribly profitable, and they are the most work to produce. However, because they take so much work to do, there’s less competition among excellent tech books for a given topic, than there is for videos, articles, or even courses,<li>Highly profitable one-person businesses work with several people so the person in the middle - you! - can leverage their time the best possible way. This means investing in people and tools to spend your time more efficient.,<li>Buy tools that make you more productive. In my case this means paying for Grammarly, Canva, my note-taking tool (Craft) or Centered app,<li>Build side projects to learn more about yourself. I have always done this, building dozens of side projects over the years.,<li>Social media not used as a channel to make a living off ,<li>Build up unfair advantages. As a one-person business, you'll have to somehow stand out among the crowd of businesses offering similar things - advice, education, entertainment and so on. While you are working full-time, can you start to build out things that will become your unfair advantage?,<li>Understand the models of making money,<li>Consider small bets on the side. Former Amazon engineer Daniel Vasallo is the pioneer of the small bets strategy for which he offers a course.

<h2>⭐️ Why the indie maker playbook is dead (or how I learned to spend money on ads), Jakob Greenfeld, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#184" id="184">&#x23;184</a>, 2022-08-22 06:48:50: Revenue screenshots always do well on Twitter. But if you supplement your screenshot with a little comment that you achieved this while spending $0 ads, you have a sure winner of a tweet. In the indie maker world, not spending money on ads is seen as a badge of honor. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/money-ads?utm_campaign=Play%20Permissionless&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">https://jakobgreenfeld.com/money-ads?utm_campaign=Play%20Permissionless&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter</a></li><li>I’m quite frugal in my personal life.

,<li>Yes, there are of course people who don’t have enough money to pay for traffic.

But many indie makers have well-paying jobs or savings and could easily afford to spend a little bit of money to validate and grow ideas faster.

The only reason why they’re not doing it is the general negative sentiment towards ads in the indie maker community.

That was 100% what was holding me back.,<li>Why spend days crafting Reddit posts hoping that one of them will go viral if I can also pay a few cents per targeted click using Reddit ads?,<li>Why spend months building an audience in a specific niche, when I can also pay some money to get a shoutout from someone who managed to do just that?</ul><hr />

<h2>A process for finding your niche, Rob Hardy, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#186" id="186">&#x23;186</a>, 2022-09-05 05:05:07: So you’re ready to build a business around your creative work, and you’ve decided to niche down. That’s rad. And awfully smart of you. Business, at its core, is about identifying a group of people with a shared need, then meeting that need. And that’s what “finding your niche” means. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://ungated.media/article/niche-process/" target="_blank">https://ungated.media/article/niche-process/</a></li><li>But here’s the thing. Nearly every creator I’ve worked with has felt trepidation before committing to a niche. There’s always—and I mean always—a nagging voice in the back of your head saying, “what if this isn’t the niche for me?” “What if I get bored?” “What if I want to create things that don’t fit in this place?”

It’s entirely possible to get this far into the process, then paralyze yourself. That voice in your head might convince you of the need for more research, or to jump ship and find another niche idea.

Here’s a little secret. If you’ve done the work above, the niche you’ve landed on is as good as it gets. If you feel at least 80% certain, there’s not a whole lot you can do to fill in that other 20%, other than committing and diving in.,<li>And for the next 2-3 weeks, I want you to live in this niche. I want you to eat, sleep, and breath it. The content, community, and commerce. Be obsessed.,<li>No niche is going to be 100% delightful, 100% of the time. In fact, you should expect to stumble across ideas and people who rub you the wrong way. That’s just the nature of the internet, and you should not take it as a sign to abandon the niche.,<li>Here’s a quick roadmap of the process we’ll be working through together.

    Brainstorm niche ideas that are tied to your identity and passions.
    Validate those ideas to see if they align with pre-existing markets.
    Build out a database (Market Map) of the major players in the niche.
    Immerse yourself in the space to ensure creative and personal fit.
    Make the commitment to show up and serve your people generously.,<li>In my course, I have students go through several different layers of self-audit. But here are some of my favorite prompts to get you started:

    The labels that most define me are…
    I feel like I belong when I’m with…
    It breaks my heart when I see…
    I’m endlessly curious about…
    The problems I’m most proud of overcoming are…,<li>There are three questions you need to answer in this stage.

    Does this niche actually exist? (Is there already a market around this idea?)
    If so, is that market big enough to support my business/financial goals?
    Is it active and engaged? (ie. are people already consuming and conversing?),<li>Every time you stumble across a related website, community, social profile, podcast, YouTube channel, or anyone/anything influential, add it to your Market Map. More specifically, you’ll want to…

    Add URLs to their main site and social channels.
    Categorize them. What type of media do they create (videos, books, podcasts, emails, etc), and optionally, what topics do they cover?
    Estimate their size/reach by looking at their subscriber/follower counts, and estimating their website traffic using a tool like SimilarWeb or Vstat. When you add enough of these sources into your database, you should be able to make a rough estimate of how big the niche is.
    Add any additional notes you think might be useful to you in the future. I like to keep track of whether I can post directly (for content sharing) and whether I’m able to be a guest (usually podcasts and YouTube interview shows). Also, if you can find contact info for the person/source, it’s a good idea to add it.</ul><hr />

We reviewed various sources, discussed priorities, accumulated feedback from customers and finally created a good model everybody believes in.,<li>Let me explain what I mean about Fast Pace Mode.

If you see that something has the name OrderStatusService, you will instinctively assume you know what it is and does, and you will probably be wrong.,<li>Names should be easy to remember and easy to spell.Names should not relate too much to the domain you’re working with. It might feel cute to name part of your zoo administration software “Tiger”, but eventually somebody’s going to be searching for “tiger” in your log files and seeing lots of irrelevant stuff about actual tigers.Names should usually not incorporate your company’s name. If everything at BongCo starts with Bong, it just makes the names longer without adding information.Names should make you smile. Yes, you, specifically. You should get a dopamine hit whenever something you created comes up, even when it’s in a sentence like “Shelob has broken again.” Fun is one of the most important things there is.Names should not describe what you currently think the thing you’re naming is for. Imagine naming your newborn child Doctor, or SupportsMeInMyOldAge. Poor kid.</ul><hr />

It gets costly because it often gets delayed, which increases the risk and work required to maintain the system.

The QRF helps ensure that important maintenance doesn’t go undone — eg. things like bugs, operational tooling, and other items.,<li>This helps prevent context shifts away from the primary focus of the organization, which should be on non-urgent, important work.

It’s ultimately a system-level optimization at a local-level cost.,<li>The biggest part of QRF’s mission is to “shift left” on interruptions. They should strive not just to react to solve the instance of a problem but to avoid the entire class of problems from ever reaching engineering in the first place.,<li>No — Scrum’s prioritization tempo can be too long. The QRF may reprioritize daily, even in some cases several times a day, depending on the fires. That’s what makes it powerful — it’s a commitment to allow for that. Scrum does the opposite — it creates a near-immutable contract that specifies that reprioritization should (ideally) only occur at the end of a sprint.,<li>The first and foremost benefit is that interruptive tasks can be handled by a single, dedicated execution stream. While that team may context switch frequently, the organization as a whole ends up switching away from important things less</ul><hr />

They just assumed that the rest existed and was built to the same quality bar. ,<li>Early customers are surprisingly accepting of the limitations of an early product that’s great at one particular thing. See: “Instagram only lets you post square pictures.”,<li>We use a tool called FullStory that allows us to see how users interact with our site. Every time we sent the demo to a customer, they looked at the “main page” for about 20 seconds. Then they closed the demo. They’d shoot back an email along the lines of, “This looks great! Let’s meet next Tuesday to talk more.”</ul><hr />

    <aside><a href="#219" id="219">&#x23;219</a>, 2022-10-02 02:55:54: Lately, it seems popular to talk smack about React.

So what are you waiting for?       ,<li>Along the way, third party React libraries have followed a similar path. Solutions like Redux appeared, got popular, and then were ditched as people realized the boilerplate just wasn't worth it. It was a necessary lesson to learn.,<li>What does any of this have to do with React? Well it's very simple. Mac OS X was the first OS that could actually seriously claim to be reactive. The standard which virtually everyone emulated back then was Windows. And in Windows, the norm—which mostly remains to this day—is that when you query information, that information is fetched once, and never updated. The user was just supposed to know that in order to see it update, they had to manually refresh it, either by bumping a selection back and forth, or by closing and reopening a dialog.   </ul><hr />

    <aside><a href="#222" id="222">&#x23;222</a>, 2022-10-06 10:04:00: What is product management (PM)? I see PM as innovation risk management. Why? In general, 50% percent of the solutions we ship won’t have an impact on customers and 50% will need lots of iterations to deliver customer value.

Why? In general, 50% percent of the solutions we ship won’t have an impact on customers and 50% will need lots of iterations to deliver customer value. This is not an issue, but a reality. The reality is that there are no requirements. Users/customers do not know what they want.,<li>I favor options over plans (be present, and act on your inspiration. It won't last forever), bets over backlogs (learn from the past, and avoid being pulled back into it), half-products over half-ass products (trade scope for quality), impact over velocity (fewer things matter more than more things), and customers over investors (the source of value is when people send you money for what you built not when you send requests for money for things you want to build. Plus, it is the CEO’s job to manage boards, not the other way around).,<li>I am skeptical of simulations and believe in decision processes designed to support building systems that quickly and cheaply roll out real things into the real world.</ul><hr />

In product development, focus is achieved by having a clear understanding of what makes your product different, i.e., the trade-offs you make at the highest level of your feature strategy by stating what your product is more about and what it is less about and the positioning rationale for each statement. These become your product’s principles and the focus filter that makes downstream prioritization less convoluted.

<h2>YAGNI exceptions, Luke Plant, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#224" id="224">&#x23;224</a>, 2022-10-18 12:57:20: I'm essentially a believer in You Aren't Gonna Need It — the principle that you should add features to your software — including generality and abstraction — when it becomes clear that you need them, and not before. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/yagni-exceptions/" target="_blank">https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/yagni-exceptions/</a></li><li>We can afford to do YAGNI only when the systems we are working with are malleable and featureful.

Most teams I’ve worked on have some process to make larger architectural decisions. This could be a larger discussion on a PR for a proof of concept. Or maybe a more formal process for making “Architectural Decisions” that leads to the creation of an ADR. ,<li>Too little novelty None of the things listed above are bad in isolation. They may bring a number of benefits: The new thing may be a better tool for solving your problem. It may help express your domain logic more cleanly. It may result in less bugs and improved development time. It may offer better performance. The codebase might become smaller and easier to maintain. It can be exciting and motivating as part of your team member’s personal development to learn new skills & technology. To me the important thing is to be conscious of the total novelty your team owns. If your team has very little novelty perhaps you could consider writing the next proof of concept using a new technology. If you find have a lot of novelty maybe it’s time to rewrite that old proof of concept that got pushed into production.</ul><hr />
<h2>How to plan?, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#226" id="226">&#x23;226</a>, 2022-10-18 13:02:32: How to plan? How hard could it be? 4k words scribbled down on a sunny October afternoon for people in tech observing the Season’s Traditional Annual Planning Process, inspired by a recent interview question (and 25 years of variously painful planning processes). </aside><ul><li><a href="https://kellanem.com/notes/how-to-plan" target="_blank">https://kellanem.com/notes/how-to-plan</a></li><li>This interview was for one of those jobs leading product and engineering which are coming back into vogue, sometimes called a GM, or CPTO, or just a VP of something or other. As an industry we’ve gotten pretty clear on the downsides of matrix management and the pendulum has started to swing the other way. ,<li>So here are a few rules of thumb for making planning suck less.  Do fewer things. Bottom up processes don’t work.  Planning is the wrong time to introduce anything new. You must provide frameworks and constraints. Project planning has an inflection point. Don’t wait to kill bad ideas. Minimize dependencies. Headcount planning won’t map to your plans. What if money is no object?,<li>The first is it acts as a point in time to synchronize our multi-threaded company.  All year we operate with different teams and functions loosely coupled. Having a moment in time when we all agree we want to collate as comprehensive a view of what we’re doing as possible is an important investment to keep us from drifting too far apart.  That’s what Planning is, a time to all get on the same page before we all start running fast again.,<li>As a leader top down planning comes with not only real cost, but real risk. There’s a good chance that you’re wrong about at least a few things. You need to be comfortable finding that out, and you need people who are willing to tell you that.,<li>Many organizations miss this critical inflection point and go sailing off into Strategic Planning with the expectations of Project Planning still firmly in place. Companies operating in this mode are the ones whose frustration with not getting the strategic results they were hoping for leads them to push for more and more fine grained planning as the antidote: an attempt to achieve greatness by optimizing for predictability.,<li>My experience being at hypergrowth companies, and also being at companies that were trying to be successful post hypergrowth is that it is important to remember that  that all code, all products, all marketing material, every piece of work product comes with long term costs, even if it’s just the cost of deleting it (something most people find surprisingly difficult). Especially in a hypergrowth environment or when money and headcount are no object, you need to be better at planning, because the only constraints are the quality of your thinking.</ul><hr />

<h2>Ditching Scrum for Kanban, Grant Ammons, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#228" id="228">&#x23;228</a>, 2022-10-19 13:11:17: The following is a story about how we matured as an engineering team. We went from an ad-hoc process to Scrum, and used Scrum for a whole year. Scrum leveled us up as a team in terms of structure and process. But it caused major morale issues. Then we found Kanban. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/cto-school/ditching-scrum-for-kanban-the-best-decision-we-ve-made-as-a-team-cd1167014a6f" target="_blank">https://medium.com/cto-school/ditching-scrum-for-kanban-the-best-decision-we-ve-made-as-a-team-cd1167014a6f</a></li><li>Scrum forced us to get more disciplined about upcoming features. The engineers needed wireframes, workflows, and light specs in order to properly estimate the work. ,<li>Peter told me that indeed, many companies follow the same path that we did. They go from no system to Scrum, which teaches them the disciplines they need to properly develop software. Then, as teams fully understand Scrum, its disciplines and rituals, teams have the option to move to Kanban.,<li>It turns out that cramming to make sprint deadlines was not the major motivating factor to get work done. We still have deadlines, and we still have a strong, motivated set of engineers and team leads.</ul><hr />
<h2>You don't need Scrum. You just need to do Kanban right., 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#229" id="229">&#x23;229</a>, 2022-10-19 13:11:17: Why did you choose Scrum instead of Kanban? If you can’t answer that question, you didn’t choose Scrum. Someone else chose it for you. All of the reasons above apply to Kanban as much as they apply to Scrum. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://lucasfcosta.com/2022/10/02/scrum-versus-kanban.html" target="_blank">https://lucasfcosta.com/2022/10/02/scrum-versus-kanban.html</a></li><li>Kanban boards were made for practicing Kanban should be a strong enough argument. Still, it’s worth highlighting that making work visible by itself doesn’t make any difference if you don’t actually use that visualisation to take action. ,<li>Furthermore, because Kanban focuses on tasks rather than sprint-sized batches, it pushes responsibility to the edges of the team, meaning engineers are responsible for going after the pieces of information they need to move forward. When that happens, instead of designing features by committee, which demands a significant amount of back-and-forth discussions, decisions happen locally, and thus are easier to make. Additionally, fewer people making decisions lead to fewer assumptions. Fewer assumptions, in turn, lead to shipping smaller pieces of software more quickly, allowing teams to truncate bad paths earlier. ,<li>Scrum is a manager’s training wheels: it prevents them from bruising their knees, but also prevents their teams from being as fast and dynamic as they could be,<li>Furthermore, it enables teams to size work effectively because it relies on rate matching instead of accurate accurate estimations, which are almost impossible to do given the stochastic nature of the software development process. Such focus on rate-matching, when combined when principles such as limiting work in progress, reduces waste because it incentivises just-in-time scoping, allowing teams to create stories closer to the time at which they’ll be implemented and shipped.,<li>Why did you choose Scrum instead of Kanban? If you can’t answer that question, you didn’t choose Scrum. Someone else chose it for you.,<li>As I mentioned before, sprint planning meetings are unproductive because they lead to “designing by committee” and focus on getting estimations right, which is not only a waste of time, but also impossible to do in a stochastic process such as software development.,<li>Kanban, on the other hand, establishes principles. Once you understand these principles, you can tailor them to your particular situation and obtain much better results.,<li>In Kanban, instead of carefully measuring each part of the process and ensuring it works uniformly, you simply focus on rate matching processes from right to left, meaning you will only start working on the next set of tires once the chassis-mounting stage has signaled its ready for more work. That way, you can dynamically adapt to problems that may happen temporarily at any part of the process. If your deployment process breaks, for example, you’ll be able to focus on fixing it instead of starting new tasks and causing everything to take longer on average, both because of the sheer amount of pending tasks and because of the cost of context switching.</ul><hr />
<h2>Developing SaaS? Forget Scrum, Check Out Kanban and Similar Approaches, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#230" id="230">&#x23;230</a>, 2022-10-19 13:11:18: Earlier this week I’ve had a chance to present WebCollage’s agile development methodology at a local Agile Practitioners meeting. At WebCollage, we are releasing a new version of our SaaS based solution to our customers every two weeks. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://onsaasproducts.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/developing-saas-forget-scrum-check-out-kanban-and-similar-approaches/" target="_blank">https://onsaasproducts.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/developing-saas-forget-scrum-check-out-kanban-and-similar-approaches/</a></li><li>Personally, I don’t feel that the metaphor is critical to success. In the end of the day, one needs to define how Issues flow through the system. Whether a tester “pulls” an Issue or whether the Issue is “pushed” by a developer downstream to a tester seems to be a matter of definition, with little practical difference. The important part is to ensure that the issues actually flow through the system and not pile up in one phase (a concept called Limit the WIP in the Kanban jargon).,<li>It is Sunday, a working day in our R&D facilities in Israel. A new iteration, towards release 2012.05, has just started. The Issue is moved from Backlog to In Play, and named IP-412. It is assigned to a specific developer. Its ranking is increased. This is a small visual enhancement, so the issue is marked as requiring visual design guidance (this is not a phase in the process but an indicator set up for the Issue). 2012-02-14 10:34am Two days pass. It is Tuesday, three days into the iteration. The designer uploads the revised graphics. 2012-02-15 9:07pm Another day passes. It is Wednesday night. The developer moves the Issue to In Development.,<li>We were easily able to address non-breakable tasks. We did not have to come up with an alternate methodology for an Issue that spanned 3 iterations.,<li>We were not forced to assemble a team of generalists. Our system is composed from some 20 unique sub-systems, dealing with Content Editing, Content Serving, Content Processing, Content Feeds, internal SDKs, Analytics, MPN/GTIN Matching, SEO, and more. Our expertise areas range from back-end systems (SQL, NoSQL) to business rule programming and front-end development (JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Attempting to get everyone to master all systems would be a futile effort. Trying to normalize all Issues into a universal scale (like Story Points) and distribute equally among team members would be a folly. ,<li>First, there is the well-known Backlog. We manage two levels of backlog Issues. The first is a Wish List, which includes any idea or request that is a candidate for inclusion in the software. In many cases, this includes a request in its raw form (I need a button that does this and that), which may transform into a different approach during product design. The second is a true Backlog, which includes items that are candidate for implementation in the near future. Issues are moved from the Wish List to the Backlog, and then, when their time has come, to the In Play collection. The second source of Issues is a Ticket system. At WebCollage, the development organization receives approximately 2 tickets a day. The Kanban approach lets us handle important tickets as they come even if they arrive during a development iteration. When an Issue is determined to be of a high priority or requires very little effort, we put it in a Fast Track, and usually address it either during the current iteration or the next one. Consequently, we can resolve an issue in an average of less than two weeks. With such a turnaround, the need for hot fixes and other exceptional handling is greatly reduced. The ticket workflow we use is the following:</ul><hr />

No amount of dating or interviewing will suffice — if you don’t already know someone you’d feel not just okay, but elated going in business with, then you’re going solo. ,<li>Being solo makes finding PMF harder in two ways: you lack a thought partner, and, most importantly, you run a bigger risk of being in denial.,<li>But the grass is always greener. Solo founders often fantasize about having “another them,” a sort of soulmate in the trenches with them. Reality often falls short. Instead of a soulmate, you might find yourself trapped with someone who greatly adds to your stress instead of subtracting from it.,<li>Do define ahead of time which decisions will require unanimous consent, and which can be made unilaterally, and by whom.

<h2>My take on why goal cascades are harmful and what to do instead, Jason Yip, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#238" id="238">&#x23;238</a>, 2022-11-08 12:29:37: As long as it’s more than one person AND it’s important that we achieve some collective goal THEN we need some way of facilitating coherent action across an organisation.

The senior-most leaders of an organisation do not have perfect knowledge, nor perfect reasoning and depending on the specific context, they don’t even have the best knowledge or reasoning.,<li>Optimal action never comes from simply aligning to top-down goals as they cascade through the organisation.,<li>Persistent models enable parallel planning</ul><hr />
<h2>Strategy deployment: from cascade to translation to synchronization., Jason Yip, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#239" id="239">&#x23;239</a>, 2022-11-08 12:30:25: Strategy deployment as cascade. We have a strategic message and we choose the right words to ensure it can be repeatedly said at all levels of the organization. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://jchyip.medium.com/strategy-deployment-from-cascade-to-translation-to-synchronization-f72f3a11b93a" target="_blank">https://jchyip.medium.com/strategy-deployment-from-cascade-to-translation-to-synchronization-f72f3a11b93a</a></li><li>Strategy deployment as simultaneous evolution with synchronization. People’s evolving understanding of context and meaning don’t actually stop while waiting for the next communication from “management”. Instead of a cascade or even a translation, it’s better to think of strategy deployment as regularly synchronizing a constantly evolving context and meaning simultaneously occurring at all levels of the organization.</ul><hr />

<h2>Connecting Dots 41 ◎⁃◎ Leaderless Teams — Brett Macfarlane, Brett Macfarlane, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#241" id="241">&#x23;241</a>, 2022-11-09 12:27:51: Welcome to Connecting Dots, the monthly newsletter on Innovation Leadership by Brett Macfarlane. I’m back in London after recent visits to Spain, France, Netherlands and Canada. Everywhere I went, the need for leadership to do more was a theme I kept hearing. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.brettmacfarlane.com/blog/2022/leadersless-teams" target="_blank">https://www.brettmacfarlane.com/blog/2022/leadersless-teams</a></li><li>In the research, groups of soldiers without an appointed leader were given a “set” problem. However, the “real” problem unbeknownst to participants was their ability to balance their desire to do well with the need to work with and support other members of the group. Observers assessed, documented and ultimately coached this capacity. What emerged from this exercise is that social class, education, gender and athletic ability were less important for leadership than the capacity for an individual to attend to others in the group. </ul><hr />
<h2>Only Solve One New Problem At A Time, Ben Nadel, 2022</h2>
    <aside><a href="#242" id="242">&#x23;242</a>, 2022-11-14 12:33:21: A few months ago, CodePen co-founders Chris Coyier and Alex Vazquez spent an hour reflecting on the top 10 lessons they've learned over the last decade of work at CodePen. The entire episode is value-packed; but, the one lesson that has haunted me is 6: One thing at a time (jump to track). </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.bennadel.com/blog/4352-only-solve-one-new-problem-at-a-time.htm" target="_blank">https://www.bennadel.com/blog/4352-only-solve-one-new-problem-at-a-time.htm</a></li><li>The example he gives in the episode is "learning Golang". Understanding how to use Golang was a new problem for the company. As such, in order to start integrating Golang into their work, they applied it in the context of an already-solved problem: sending emails. This way, Golang was the "one thing" they were solving—the email-sending logic already existed in Ruby; and, they just had to port it over to a new application server.,<li>When you build and integrate code incrementally as a rule, you are forced to think about the work differently. You have to break it up into smaller problems. And, the order in which those problems are solved (and integrated) starts to matters. This, in turn, allows you - and your external stakeholders - to create a better sense of how long things will take, how often value will be added, how far the project is progressing, and how the path forward (and expectations regarding delivery) might need to be adjusted. ,<li>f I could be so bold as to add a corollary to the rule of "one new problem at a time", I'd suggest that if it can't be done incrementally, don't do it. Over the last 6-years, feature flags have revolutionized the way that I work. And, a majority-stake in that change is the fact that everything I do is now built and integrated incrementally. Until you've worked this way, it's hard to even articulate why this is so powerful. But, I literally can't imagine building anything of any significance without an incremental path forward.</ul><hr />

Everyone at the organization should know why they’re at the company, what they’re building and for whom; and they should be able to understand and tell that story in a consistent way.,<li>The sociologist mode: When it’s time to make the best decision for the company, leaders should be in sociologist mode.The psychologist mode: When working through problems one-on-one with an employee, leaders should be in psychologist mode.,<li>Be authenticOne of the most effective ways to build trust as a leader is to be authentic and vulnerable.

Find the right org structure for you *right now*No organization structure is ever going to work 100% of the time. When coming up with an org structure, you need to think about what you’re optimizing for at this moment in time and for the next set of deliverables. Then organize around that. You’re never going to have the perfect structure — something is going to feel wonky and you’re going to have to be okay with that.,<li>“If I say, ‘We’re going to deliver x on y, but we’re going to burn people out to get there,’ that matters to my employees,” explains Warner. “But if we’re never going to deliver something because we don’t want to burn people out, that also matters to my team. You need to find the right balance between what you do and how you do it in order to keep your employees around long-term.”,<li>Worry about too many programming languages and frameworks. Multiple build systems are okay, but you don’t want 14 different programming languages. Pick one compiled language and one dynamic language and stick to them.,<li>When it comes to setting up principles and practices, Warner suggests creating just enough processes to have a structured organization without creating too many limitations. But he adds in the caveat of context. As you’re reading about best practices and ways in which other organizations have been successful, note the size of the organization, how new it is and how they operate. What works for one company might not work for you in the same way.</ul><hr />

One reason that I sometimes procrastinate on staring into the abyss is that, when I try to think about the uncomfortable topic, I don’t do it in a productive way: instead, I’ll ruminate or think myself in circles. If I’m talking to someone else, they can help me break out of those patterns and make progress. They can also be an accountability buddy for actually spending time thinking about the thing.,<li>Recently I’ve been thinking about how all my favorite people are great at a skill I’ve labeled in my head as “staring into the abyss.”1 Staring into the abyss means thinking reasonably about things that are uncomfortable to contemplate, like arguments against your religious beliefs, or in favor of breaking up with your partner. It’s common to procrastinate on thinking hard about these things because it might require you to acknowledge that you were very wrong about something in the past, and perhaps wasted a bunch of time based on that,<li>This suggests that a critical part of being effective at staring into the abyss is timing. If you do it too little, you’ll end up taking too long to make important life improvements; but if you do it too often, you might end up not investing enough in being great at your current job or relationship because you’re too focused on the prospect of next one.</ul><hr />

Does not focus at all on making explicit and clarifying the acceptable and unacceptable tradeoffs in achieving those shared goals.,<li>Boris works because it forces decisionmaking stakeholders to talk about what they are willing to give up to get what they really want. Being aware of tradeoffs and agreeing on which ones are acceptable is essential to both good strategy and good execution.</ul><hr />

Can the team articulate the underlying reasons that the old system is failing? Sometimes there are clear causes, but often it is more nebulous (“The users are complaining about the old system, so we need to rewrite it,” or, “Java sucks and Rust is cool”). If you can’t even articulate why the old system is bad, how do you know that the new system is going to fix it?,<li>Unless your system is very small, or new and barely used (in which case, why are you rewriting it?), there is no way that you have thought through all of the pieces of code you will actually need to replicate. ,<li>I’m not saying you should never rewrite anything.

    <aside><a href="#264" id="264">&#x23;264</a>, 2022-12-28 09:12:17: I never used to think of myself as a software engineer.

The science part is important. We need to iterate so that we can have more opportunities to learn. We need to gather feedback so that we can reflect on the results. We need to work incrementally so that we can compartmentalize the problems in front of us and explore them efficiently. We need to organize our work into a series of small, safe experiments so that we can build our knowledge up in a more productive way. We need to capture data from real world systems so that we can learn empirically what really works and what doesn't. These are the tools of scientific reasoning. These are the tools of real "engineering.”,<li>Most engineers don't ever expect to get things right the first time. If you get it right the first time, you aren't learning, you are just fulfilling your expectations.,<li>My take on continuous delivery is consciously centered on applying scientific reasoning to solving problems in software. We create deployment pipelines that allow us to iterate fast, aiming to create a production-releasable outcome multiple times per day</ul><hr />

Both cases usually result in catastrophic failure, followed by tears and despair.,<li>Doing a lot of refinement is a great way to waste time because it will cause people to think about how to handle every single edge case that comes to mind, including the ones that will probably never happen and don’t impact the overall goal. If that sounds too productive, don’t worry. Even then, people will not think about the edge cases that truly matter: the ones that will come up as developers write code. That way, you can maximize the time developers waste, thus increasing costs. ,<li>the best way to ensure nothing gets done is to design by committee,<li>Backlogs are the best way to avoid difficult conversations. Whenever someone wants developers to implement a new feature, you can tell them you’re going to “add it to the backlog” and forget about it. Then, when they ask you about that feature again, you can tell them it’s still in the backlog and that you just haven’t had the time to get to it. </ul><hr />

    <aside><a href="#278" id="278">&#x23;278</a>, 2023-01-17 02:01:03: Alle vier Minuten werden Menschen in wissensintensiven Berufen im Schnitt bei der Arbeit unterbrochen. Anderthalb Tage pro Woche verbringen sie in Meetings, mindestens zweimal pro Stunde versuchen sie Multitasking. Sinnvoll ist das kaum. Und vor allem ziemlich teuer. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.brandeins.de/magazine/brand-eins-thema/it-dienstleister-2023/arbeiten-wie-ich-wirklich-wirklich-will" target="_blank">https://www.brandeins.de/magazine/brand-eins-thema/it-dienstleister-2023/arbeiten-wie-ich-wirklich-wirklich-will</a></li><li>Das ganze Homeoffice-Thema wird falsch, weil binär diskutiert. Wenn ich gegen Home-office bin, bin ich das Unternehmer-Schwein. Bin ich fürs Homeoffice, bin ich super New Work. Keiner guckt zum Beispiel aus der psychologischen Perspektive: Was brauchen Menschen für Bindungen? Was braucht es, um miteinander kreativ zu sein? Das sollten die Fragestellungen sein.,<li>Wir empfehlen, dass Dringliches über einen Kanal geht, beispielsweise den Firmenchat. Und Wichtigkeit geht über einen anderen Kanal, meist per E-Mail oder über das Projektmanagement-Programm. Denn wichtiger Inhalt geht oft mit Dateianhängen einher.,<li>Es gibt da zwei weitere interessante Studien. Die eine belegt eine Korrelation zwischen Meeting-Effizienz und Unternehmenserfolg. Das heißt: Produktive Meetings zahlen sich aus. Und die andere besagt: Je früher am Tag Meetings liegen, desto eher machen die Leute Multitasking – einfach weil noch viel vor ihnen liegt. Genau deswegen plädieren wir für eine Fokuszeit am Vormittag. ,<li>Eigentlich mache ich, was ich tue, total gern, nur nicht in der Art und Weise, wie ich es tun muss. Deswegen sollte es heißen: Arbeiten, wie ich wirklich, wirklich will.,<li>Wenn ich Führungskräfte frage, wo die Schrauben sind, an denen wir drehen müssen, sagen sie alle, wirklich alle: Ich möchte in Ruhe arbeiten können. Ich möchte nicht von Meeting zu Meeting hetzen und immer zu spät kommen, weil ich zwischendurch mal zur Toilette war.     So gestresst erleben Sie die Kunden? Ja, total. Allerdings stecken sie oft auch in einer, wie wir es nennen, Erwartungserwartung: Sie denken nur, dass sie dauernd erreichbar sein müssen. Wenn man dann mit den Unternehmerinnen oder dem Vorstand spricht, sagen die: Moment mal, das haben wir doch nie gefordert!,<li>Ja. Stattdessen sollte es völlig in Ordnung sein, wenn jemand sagt: Ich habe in vier Stunden einen top Job gemacht, ich bin fertig. Da sollten auch nicht vier Stunden abgezogen werden. Die Person hat das Ergebnis gebracht, das sie bringen musste, sodass alle anderen weiterarbeiten können und das Gesamtergebnis steht. Doch stattdessen messen wir lächerlicherweise die Produktivität von Denkarbeit am Achtstundentag und sponsern den Yoga-Kurs, damit der Rücken nicht durchbricht. Das sind Symptompflaster.,<li>Das durch die Pandemie erzwungene millionenfache Arbeiten im Homeoffice hat beileibe nicht jeden beglückt, manchen hat es sogar krankhaft erschöpft. Viele mussten erkennen, dass ihnen Struktur und Strategie fehlen, um die neu gewonnenen tatsächlichen oder vermeintlichen Errungenschaften der Telearbeit zu genießen.,<li>Genau das aber ist die Herausforderung von New Work: Es verlangt, Verantwortung für sich selbst zu übernehmen und den eigenen Tag so zu organisieren, dass ich selbstwirksam sein kann.      ,<li>Wenn das Smartphone dauernd entsperrt werden muss, weil es Arbeitsnachrichten empfängt, werden naturgemäß auch private Nachrichten angezeigt. Es kostet Überwindung, die zu ignorieren. Das verbraucht Energie, die fehlt, um sich zu konzentrieren.,<li>Wir lassen die Kunden sich selbst 25 Fragen stellen und diskutieren, wie sie Lösungen finden, um fokussierter arbeiten zu können. Das tun sie auf den fünf Feldern Arbeitsorganisation, Meetings, Führung, eigenes Verhalten und Kultur. Das Modell ist für Unternehmen gedacht und als Open Knowledge frei zugänglich,<li>Wer bewusst so zwei Stunden am Vormittag in Ruhe arbeiten kann, geht ganz anders durch den Tag. Der Spiegel des Stresshormons Cortisol im Blut sinkt messbar. Voraussetzung ist aber, dass das Management diese Fokuszeit nicht nur will, sondern auch selbst nutzt und durchsetzt. </ul><hr />

<h2>Culture by Poster, Simon Cross, 2023</h2>
    <aside><a href="#287" id="287">&#x23;287</a>, 2023-02-10 06:54:35: Done is better than perfect. Don’t mistake motion for progress. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.simoncross.com/p/culture-by-poster" target="_blank">https://www.simoncross.com/p/culture-by-poster</a></li><li>Sean Byrnes has written about this eloquently and persuasively. He offers a simple framework:  Activities that are internal to the business are motion. These include: Implementing new tools; Implementing new processes; Building a new report; Attending regular meetings. Activities that affect your position in the market are progress. These include: Adding new customers; Improving customer satisfaction; Making money; Hiring new people; Layoffs.  “What was the impact?” is the single most powerful question in management. If you (or the person your questioning) can’t immediately explain the business impact — or how this thing clearly moves us toward creating business impact (progress): you have a problem,<li>4: “It isn’t prioritisation until it hurts”,<li>We thought we were measuring progress: # of events run, # of attendees — but we were actually just measuring motion - things we thought were important, but didn’t have any clear connection to business outcomes.,<li>B/ “Break Things” Some people have read this as “cause disruption without thought for the consequences” - but to me this means something more subtle: have a healthy disrespect for the status quo, and a willingness to question why things are they way they are. ,<li>1: “Done is better than perfect”  This is about two things: A) improvement through iteration and B) opportunity cost.,<li>2: “Don’t mistake motion for progress”,<li>Now, this increase in speed wasn’t accidental - it was intentful, It took WORK. A lot of work. And created risk — potentially making it more likely for a bug to takedown one of the worlds largest communication platforms on whom billions of people relied.,<li>Things to think about:  Stack rank: As a team, ask yourself the question: if we could only do ONE of these two things, which would we do?   Sequencing: If you have two things that are clearly important — ask yourself, is one more urgent than the other? If feature A is as valuable if built next half as it is this half, but feature B is more valuable if built now, then build B before A. Remember (and say to yourself and your team!) that just because we’re down-pri’ing thing X, doesn’t mean it’s not important and we’ll never do it — it’s just less important RIGHT NOW — it may well be the most important thing next planning cycle.   One in, one out: When someone asks for “just one more thing” in the roadmap: ask them: which of these other features would they’d like you to drop? If they can’t identify one, you’ve already done your job well.,<li>But this isn’t where you should be spending your time — you need to be up the other end of the roadmap looking at your P1’s. If you only de-pri the easy stuff, you’ll end up with many high-pri things to do — each of which looks important and urgent — because because you’ve not had the hard, frank conversations required to really really tease out what matters most.,<li>This tradition started, the story goes, when the company approached 150 employees (Dunbar’s number). A designer, Ben Barry, realised that as the company grew, it would be harder to infect new joiners with the principles and tenets that the first employees organically shared. A screen-printing enthusiast, he made up some posters and stuck them around the office</ul><hr />

Splitting your time across both functions isn’t ideal for pursuing either path, and unfortunately it’s the rare role and organization that supports ongoing growth for folks in tech lead manager roles.

In this case, the team can declare the invoice template in all its forms to be a noise factor. At the same time, they could decide that the email where the invoice is delivered is now a control factor. They could redesign the solution slightly by mentioning in the text of the email that this is a recurring invoice, above where the existing invoice template is rendered. This is what designing around the noise factor means — taking the noise factor as a constraint, stepping back, questioning assumptions, and finding a new design that still meets the overall goals with the control factors.,<li>If we treat everything across this interdependence as a control factor — meaning all of it is in scope — that leads down the path of growing the scope to include fixing or replacing the PDF tooling,<li>If we treat everything across this interdependence as a control factor — meaning all of it is in scope — that leads down the path of growing the scope to include fixing or replacing the PDF tooling.

The alternative is straight from Bob’s quote: to treat the interdependence as a noise factor. That means breaking the chain by deciding that the PDF generation isn’t going to change as part of this project. But remember that wasn’t the end of the quote.

Simply dropping a requirement because it’s hard can accumulate as low UX quality over time.,<li> In this example, deciding the PDF tooling is a noise factor actually opens up that work for parallelization. The PDF tooling and the recurring invoices become independent efforts, that can be worked on by different people at different times. The invoice team doesn’t have to wait to deploy their new functionality, and meanwhile — or in the future — another team can replace what happens behind the PDF generation API to use better tooling,<li>The alternative is straight from Bob’s quote: to treat the interdependence as a noise factor.

More robust tests typically yield higher-quality evidence. Therefore, you may want to jump straight into a large-scale test. But, robust tests usually require more time and investments to carry out. Instead, you want to start small to get early signals of being on the right track or do rapid course corrections if learning otherwise. So, start small and iterate towards “(…) bigger, more reliable, more sound tests, only after each previous round provides an indicator that continuing to invest is worth the effort.” Teresa Torres.,<li>Making both top-down and bottom-up estimations of TAM (total available market), SAM (serviceable available market), and TM (target market) is a good start. 100% accuracy is not the point, instead, use these estimations as a quick sanity check and decide whether to move forward.,<li>Reduce the risk as much as possible before building anything,<li>For a product to be successful, it needs a well-driven business around it.

You run some code, but if there’s a problem, the code “throws an exception”; it stops running and triggers something else to happen instead. Here’s what you do:  Document the decision as you would in #1 or #2 (what’s the problem, what are the options, what are the tradeoffs).   State your “recommendation” — the option you want to go with.   Email this to your leadership team (include a traffic light!)

They try to make the few important decisions on the highest level of conceptual understanding. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://hbr.org/1967/01/the-effective-decision" target="_blank">https://hbr.org/1967/01/the-effective-decision</a></li><li>ffective executives know when a decision has to be based on principle and when it should be made pragmatically, on the merits of the case. They know the trickiest decision is that between the right and the wrong compromise, and they have learned to tell one from the other. They know that the most time-consuming step in the process is not making the decision but putting it into effect. Unless a decision has degenerated into work, it is not a decision; it is at best a good intention. This means that, while the effective decision itself is based on the highest level of conceptual understanding, the action commitment should be as close as possible to the capacities of the people who have to carry it out. Above all, effective executives know that decision making has its own systematic process and its own clearly defined elements.</ul><hr />

<h2>Slack, Martin Fowler, 2023</h2>
    <aside><a href="#321" id="321">&#x23;321</a>, 2023-04-08 11:22:15: A common approach with Timeboxed Iterations is to allocate as many UserStories as possible to each iteration in order to maximize the utilization of the staff involved. Slack is the policy of deliberately leaving time that isn't allocated for stories, using that time for unplanned work. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Slack.html" target="_blank">https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Slack.html</a></li><li>One benefit of this approach is that it reduces the variability of story completion. Rather than wondering if this iteration will complete those last five of a 20 story allocation, we can expect 15 with high confidence. For planning and coordination, higher confidence is often worth more than trying to maximize throughput,<li>While slack is both important and often undervalued, it's a seasoning not the main dish. A schedule that's all slack gives up visibility and longer-term planning. But to run without it is like skimping on your oil changes,<li>While I've described slack here in terms of Timeboxed Iterations it is also important to Continuous Flow. The smell here is if a continuous flow team is always busy - that indicates not enough slack, which will make them slower to respond to requests and unable to look after their working environment. ,<li>a range: say from 15 to 22. In this situation the team can plan at their lowest consistent number (15) and treat the additional time as slack. ,<li>But doing more stories is often not the most productive thing to do. Most teams are slowed by factors in their working environment. There may be inefficiencies in the build process, cruft in the code base, or unfamiliarity with productivity tools (most people have all sorts of undiscovered gems in their IDEs). Spending the slack time on these can make a big difference by increasing productivity in future interactions. Indeed the most common productivity problem teams face is due to a congested schedule that allows these impediments to fester.</ul><hr />

    <aside><a href="#322" id="322">&#x23;322</a>, 2023-04-08 11:24:54: Continuous flow is an approach to scheduling work, often associated with agile software development.

Just like computers, this context switching takes up extra time and effort/clock cycles which is not a productive use of our time. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://tatask.com/blog/multitasking-is-a-myth" target="_blank">https://tatask.com/blog/multitasking-is-a-myth</a></li><li>Mono tab,<li>Single monitor</ul><hr />
<h2>Deadlines as Technology, Jim Nielsen, 2023</h2>
    <aside><a href="#341" id="341">&#x23;341</a>, 2023-06-08 02:10:49: Confession: I’ve never felt like a very productive person. During the mobile app explosion, circa ~2009, I remember trying all kinds of different “productivity” apps that I thought were going to make me efficient and productive. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/deadlines-as-technology/" target="_blank">https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/deadlines-as-technology/</a></li><li>The only technology that you need is deadlines.,<li>Deadlines are huge, but really what are deadlines? They’re opportunities to fail. That’s all they are. They’re actually opportunities to learn, to fail. Hopefully not fail catastrophically, but it’s an incredible data gathering moment.</ul><hr />
<h2>Notes apps are where ideas go to die. And that’s good., Matthew Guay, 2023</h2>
    <aside><a href="#342" id="342">&#x23;342</a>, 2023-06-08 02:14:00: We don’t write things down to remember them. We write them down to forget. Like a hunter/gatherer stashing their prey, the ideas and the links we stumble upon feel valuable, rare, something worth saving. We ascribe value to the time we spend discovering things online. </aside><ul><li><a href="https://www.reproof.app/blog/notes-apps-help-us-forget" target="_blank">https://www.reproof.app/blog/notes-apps-help-us-forget</a></li><li>By letting go, you’ve cleared up space for new quests. No more dozens of tabs open forever; you saved them, then let them go back into the ether. No perpetual thinking on an idea; you wrote it down, let your second brain remember for you.
Then we’re free.,<li>We don’t write things down to remember them. We write them down to forget.,<li>We need to forget, but we first must feel safe forgetting.</ul><hr />
